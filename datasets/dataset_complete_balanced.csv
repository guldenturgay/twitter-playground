happy, Thank you for a wonderful meal . 
happy, You are witty . 
happy, So ... disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it.And breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether . 
happy," Right , a disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music ... "
happy, And disco a kind of nightclub . 
happy," Well , breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance . "
happy, Like disco ? 
happy," According to the story , it's some sort of modern dance style . "
happy, What does it say ? 
happy, It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed . 
happy, Okay . I'm in . Let's do it . 
happy, Great . I'll get our plan started right away . 
happy,How do you like this waltz ? 
happy, There's a story about breakdancing in the paper . 
happy, You dance well . Do you breakdance ? 
happy, With pleasure . 
happy,May I invite you for a dance ? 
happy, All right . Let me get you something to drink . 
happy," Sorry , I think I'Il sit out the next dance . "

happy, Thanks for the advice . 
happy, No problem . 
happy, What is the weather like in Washington at this time of this year ? 
happy," Yes , I can see . The summer heat is over , and the winter cold is still far away . "
happy," Autumn is the best season in Beijing , you know . "
happy,The weather in Beijing is just beautiful ! 
happy, That's correct . We have four seasons of spring . 
happy," I've heard the weather here is ideal , just like spring most of the year . "
happy, You can say that again.The sun is shining and there is a pleasant breeze.It ' s so lovely . 
happy,How nice it is here . 
happy, Absolutely ! Bob and his whole family are welcome here any time ! 
happy, I like spring . The days are long and the night are short . The flowers are in bloom.We go on picnics . 
happy," Haha , jogging ? Perhaps it might be a bit too boring ? "
happy, That's okay . I like it better that way anyway . 
happy," Well , it costs an arm and a leg — 30 yuan per person . What a costly sport ! That is why I have to refrain from even thinking about it . And I find jogging a very agreeable substitute . "
happy, My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . 
happy," Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . "
happy,"Hi , I'm home ! Can you double that recipe ? I ran into an old friend after work and invited him for dinner . "
happy," Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's pent-up feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll and the break dance . "
happy, Yes . And what dances do you do best ? 
happy, Thank you for your compliments.It ' s just that you are a good leader . Do you like the fox-trot and tango ? 
happy," I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner . "
happy," Oh , really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well . "
happy," You know what ? You won't get a rush from it until you fully understand it . It is a simple sport and doesn't require skills of any sort . This leaves room for me to enjoy the beautiful suburban scenery while jogging . Fresh air caresses my face and blows into my chest , which translates into inspirations . Inspirations are really good stuff for a writer like me . Sometimes , I even come up with a verse or two . "
happy," Yes , disco dancing is my favorite.It ' s great fun and good exercise as well . "
happy, Yes . 
happy," Well , I've been looking forward to seeing you . "
happy, Guangzhou . I've got a cousin there . 
happy," Fine , just fine . And you ? "

happy, Oh . I'm just going to take it easy . 
happy," Thanks , but I don't want to put you into any trouble . "
happy, Don't be silly . It's no trouble at all . 
happy,Merry Christmas ! 
happy, Sure . Let's buy it . 
happy," Well , as a matter of fact , I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas . "
happy," I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ? "
happy, Thanks ! 
happy, What should I do then ? 
happy,Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . What a life ! I've had enough of it . 
happy," Quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ? "
happy," To tell you the truth , I have never thought of being a swimmer . I swim just for fun . "
happy," Say , kid , keep on practicing , you're sure to be a first-class swimmer . "
happy, Okay . I'll pick you up at 6:00 . 
happy, Sounds like a good idea . 
happy," Well , uh ... why not dine out together and go to the movies ? "
happy,T he nineteenth of June is my birthday . I'm planning to have a small party . Could you come ? 
happy," Happy birthday to you ! I'd really love to come , but I'm not sure right now . I'll try to make it.Thank you for your invitation . "
happy,Do you like swimming ? 
happy," Yes . Swimming is one of my most favorite sports , indoors or out-doors . "
happy," Thanks , I'm enough . "
happy,"Another glass of beer , will you ? "
happy, Great idea ! 
happy, Why don't we go to a concert instead ? 
happy, No . I heard that's really boring . 
happy, I'd rather not . I don't like horror movies . 
happy, Candlelight in the Window 
happy, Do you want to go see a movie ?

happy," Let me see . Uh-huh ... no , I guess I'll be free . "
happy, How about the dessert ? 
happy, Another piece of meat pie ? 
happy," No , thanks . I'm full . "
happy, Would you like some more rice ? 
happy," Yes , I did . I have never tasted anything like this . "
happy, Did you enjoy your dinner ? 
happy," Fine , they are colorful and tasty . "
happy,How do you like these dishes ? 
happy," Yes , but not always . However , I won't let it go if I have a chance . "
happy, Have you ever swum in a river or a lake ? 
happy," I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits , and enable people to be fearless of the hardships , dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch . "
happy," Me too . Swimming is a very good exercise for health . It combines water , bath , sunbath , and air bath together . It promotes the growth and haleness of muscles , bone , viscera and nerve systems . "
happy," No , thanks . I'm on diet . "
happy, Just fine . I say . Aren't you busy tomorrow evening ? 
happy, Have a great time tomorrow night . 
happy," Yeah , I want the note . "
happy, Of course ! I really love watching football games on TV . 
happy, In a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ? 
happy," Hug and kiss ? ! How is it possible ? Oh , it's really bad to Miun - Verstand her meaning . "
happy," Really ? What kind ? A girl left this word to me , and I thought she was in Hong Kong . "
happy," ZZZ means'sleepy or tired or bored ' , A / S / L is tricky , which is often used at first encounter . It's a three-word question , ' age , / sex / location ? ' "
happy, I'm really confused by these annoying abbreviations . 
happy," Oh , that's great . I want to try later . "
happy," Okay . BBS , an online service , offers a wide variety of online games , files , one-on-one chat , message areas , private mail , and participate forums . "
happy, Tell me in details . 
happy, Booze ! 
happy, I got Jacob . Any ideas what to get him ? 
happy," Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . "
happy, OK . I'll take it . 
happy, Would you care for a drink ? 
happy, It's nice to be here . 
happy,Come in . It's nice to see you again . 
happy," A glass of white wine would be fine , thank you . "
happy, What would you like to drink ? 
happy, That means a lot to me Dad . Thanks . 
happy, We have great confidence in you . 
happy, Thank you for inviting me . 
happy,"Good evening , I'm so happy you could come . "
happy, I'd love a gin and tonic . 
happy, What can I get you ? 
happy, Whose name did you pick ? 
happy,Hi ! I'm happy you could make it . 
happy," Sure , that would be great . "
happy, That's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go . 
happy," Sorry . What can I say ? Now , do you want the note or what ? "
happy, That colored one is very beautiful . It may suit my furniture . How much do you ask for it ? 
happy, You're kidding ! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything . 
happy, You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ? 
happy," But , you work with her everyday . "
happy, I do like it . Can you come down a bit ? 
happy, You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken ! 
happy, What were you writing ? 
happy," You're right . I should talk to him . Sometimes , it's not easy being a parent . Thanks . It helps to get it off my chest . You're always so easy to talk to . "
happy," You may be right , but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life . "
happy, I haven't yet . I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through . 
happy, Of course . Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ? 
happy, How about going to a concert ? 
happy, Merry Christmas to you ! 
happy," Oh , the day after tomorrow is Christmas . "
happy, You're so old-fashioned . That's what people used to think about people from another country ! 
happy, I hope not . I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on the Earth . 
happy, Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ? 
happy, Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ? 
happy, That sounds crazy . But they can't just change their mind about things like that . 
happy," Nice try . I wasn't born yesterday , you know . "
happy, What's that ? 
happy, Let's hope so . 
happy, Thank goodness we're not rich and famous ! 
happy, I don't think so . 
happy," Then you must be interested in disco dancing , aren't you ? "
happy, That's great ! I love to dance to fast music . 
happy," I'm glad you like it.The band is called "" Four and One "" . They are especially good at playing rock and roll . "
happy,Tomorrow is Sunday . Let's go out and get some fresh air . 
happy, I'll never again come to your side ; I am turn away now and can't return . 
happy, It's on the 2nd floor . We are going to see some beautiful paintings about the history of ancient Greece . 
happy," Sure , take your time . We have a whole day . "
happy, I have no idea . Let me take a closer look at my museum map 
happy, ( After the breakfast ) Which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ? 
happy, Good idea . 
happy, Yeah . We are lucky . Let's go buy the tickets first . We can have breakfast later . I am so hungry . 
happy, Look at the ticket booth in the center . There seems to be not as many people as we thought it would be . 
happy, I guess that is the thing we can do with we really want to visit the museum . 
happy," I don't think so . I think we had better go there earlier , or we may have to spend a lot of time waiting . "
happy, Sure . I am free tomorrow . It sounds interesting to me . Can we buy the ticket online ? 
happy,"Dora , are you interested in going to the museum with me tomorrow ? I read the newspaper this morning . I know there is an art exhibition in Taipei Modern Art Museum . "
happy, But the Reds keep a weak midfield . I think Juventas of Italian Series A have always maintained a very formidable midfield . It is the main source of its strength . 
happy, What's her outlook ? 
happy, Can you describe the situation at that time ? 
happy, Have you fallen in love ? 
happy,"Herman , why are you so excited ? "
happy, Let's go buy their new album . Want to come with me ? 
happy, Sure . I think you can hear the song everywhere you go now . 
happy, Thank you very much . Bye . 
happy, You're welcome . Bye . 
happy," The lyrics of the new song are beautiful , too . Can you sing ? "
happy, I know there is a beautiful farm in the countryside near Taipei . Are you interested in going there ? 
happy, why not ? I love animals and I love nature . 
happy," You can see many cows and horses there . lf you are brave enough , you can try horseback riding . it is fun . "
happy, sounds very interesting . I can't wait to go there . 
happy," That is true . Speaking of cavities , I am starting to feel something is wrong with my teeth now . Let's get more strawberry chocolate drops before we go home . "
happy, You are a candy terminator . Be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities . 
happy," To be honest , I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat . I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not . "
happy, Me too . I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people . 
happy, I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything . 
happy," They have lollypops , chocolate drops , fruit candy , mints , pearbrittles and toffee . They are in different colors and flavors . "
happy, Look at the candy bar over there . It is so colorful and tasty . 
happy," why not ? I would like to buy some candies . Since there are so many people , I think they must have delicious candy . "
happy, Are you serious ? It is always crowded with many people . 
happy, A new candy shop just opened around the corner last week . They have a variety of candies and it is always full of people . 
happy,I have a sweet tooth . I can not help but think about having something sweet between meals . 
happy, I really love their dancing . They are all excellent dancers . 
happy, Thank you . Do you need the invoice ? 
happy, Sure . I'll get right on it . 
happy," It is . However , you will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider . "
happy, Wait and see . I want to try horseback riding after fishing . It looks very exciting and fun . 
happy, Of course . I will . 
happy, Yes . we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake . Who do you think will catch a big fish first ? 
happy, I think we need to buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first . 
happy," Well , now you know . Let's go to the lake over there . Some people are fishing over there . I haven't had a chance to fish in a lake , I really want to try . "
happy, I never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm . 
happy," That is true . Some people go camping , some people pick fresh fruit , some people go boating and some people go grass skiing . "
happy, Wow ! It is huge and you can do many activities here . 
happy, Thank you . 
happy, No problem . It is always worth trying something new once in your life time . 
happy," Yes , their new album just came out last week . It is number one on the billboard . "
happy, Really ? Their songs are very popular all round Asia now . I am also a big fan of theirs . 
happy," Don't be so shy , Lucy . "
happy," Right . By the mid - 50 ' s , this light-hearted genre was competing with films about more serious subjects . There was one kind that could be found throughout all of these years , and that was the , mm , the . . . "
happy," After all that violence , people needed to laugh , so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s , many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made . Then came musicals . "
happy, Mm . What came after that ? 
happy, Gangster movies . Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it . 
happy, Not bad . What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s 
happy," Of course . Wait for a moment , please . "
happy," Too easy questions . Listen carefully . Hollywood is the movie capital of the world.It is located in southern California . Many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often . "
happy, You are full of boasts . I can examine you by question and answer . What is Hollywood ? Where is it ? What is the function of it ? 
happy, What ? How much do you know Hollywood ? 
happy," Is that so ? We're using lures , and the fish are biting those too . "
happy,What are you using for bait today ? 
happy," The western films about America's cowboys , Indians and early settlers . "
happy,Welcome to our bar ! 
happy,"I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York , to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida . "
happy, Thanks . 
happy, My pleasure . 
happy," Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . "
happy," Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's hidden feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll nor break-dancing . "
happy, Yes . And what dances do you like best ? 
happy, Thank you for your compliments . It's just you are a good leader . Do you like the foxtrot and tango ? 
happy, I'm glad you say so . You dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got you as a partner . 
happy," Oh , really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well . "
happy, Thank you . 
happy," Well , then , may I invite you for the first dance ? "
happy," Don't jump to conclusions . Look at the bright side , try to make another date again . "
happy, Really ? 
happy, Come on . 
happy," I've never had one person that I'd idolized . The comparisons to Jul-ia Roberts are incredibly flattering . I don't really know who I would compare myself to . I'd like to be a combination of a lot of people . A little bit of everything , really . I haven't quite figured out where my strengths are yet , and I've definitely found my weaknesses . "
happy, That sounds like a blue rose ! My sitting by his bed ? 
happy," Just come to our house and stay over . You'll sit by his bed and greet him like a beautiful red rose , ' Good morning ! ' "
happy, So what am I going to do ? 
happy, Take my word for it . 
happy, It can't be true . 
happy," Yes . If you put a few drops on someone's eyelids while he's asleep , he'll fall in love with the first person he sees when he wakes up . "
happy, A magic love potion ? 
happy," I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers . "
happy,Pretty ! Say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure ? 
happy, He is so humorous . 
happy, He joked later that I was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant . 
happy, Any more ? 
happy, It's a romantic meeting . I can say that a hero saves a beauty . 
happy, Then he sent you to your home ? 
happy," I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked , ' Where is your home ? ' "
happy, And then ? 
happy, That is a heavy raining afternoon . I was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain . It's getting dark . 
happy,How did you first meet Jack each other ? 
happy," No , he is the sort of man who likes to hide his candle under a bushel . "
happy, That means he was head over heels in love with you . 
happy, He said that I put all other girls in the shade . 
happy, He must be all over you the first time he saw you . 
happy, We actually met at a dance party . He fell for me . 
happy,It seems to me that you are on very good terms with him . 
happy, Yeah . 
happy, Which one ? 
happy, She is Miao Li . She's come here to see her brother . 
happy, OK . She's a costume designer and works in a garment mill . 
happy," I do , but I would appreciate you , if it could be arranged . "
happy," I see . We have already received many bookings and though I can't guarantee anything , please be assured that we'll try our best , Mr . Davis . I hope you'll understand . "
happy," Oh , any chance of a table by the window ? My wife loves the bird's eye view . As it's her birthday , I want it to be a celebration . "
happy, Of course . 
happy," Great . At first , you can put the chairs back . "
happy," Thank you , Mr . Davis . "
happy, Thank you . I'll wash them . 
happy, OK . Then I will clean the table . 
happy, Good boy . 
happy, Davis . 
happy," Fine ! I'll reserve a table for two at 8 pm , sir . May I have your name , please ? "
happy, We'll try our best . 
happy," I'm not sure , perhaps around 8 pm . "
happy, I see . I'd like to reserve a table for two . 
happy," We open at 6:30 , sir . "
happy, What time do you open this evening ? 
happy,Good morning . Sanyu Restaurant . May I help you ? 
happy," That's right . His voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the Spanish Caribbean where he grew up . He has fan clubs across the world , from America to Russia , from England to Taiwan , from Norway to Australia . "
happy," I heard one observer even said ' It was a song sung in Spanish for international football , and he made it so popular that even the Americans loved it . ' "
happy, He is really great . He has sold millions of records worldwide . He is especially known for his rocking performance at the football World Cup song-the Cup of World . 
happy, He seems to win awards everywhere . 
happy," Yeah . I was so happy , because my favorite singer , Ricky Martin won ' Best Latin Pop Performance ' . "
happy,Did you see the 2005 Grammy Awards on TV last night . 
happy, Very good . 
happy," Yes , sir . What time would you like your table , sir ? "
happy, Sure . The main courses are roast Beijing duck and fried eel slices . 
happy," How did you get that ? No need to show you my hand , I lose.This is not as much fun as the music concert we just saw . "
happy, Have you heard Maria Carey ? 
happy," That's a great idea . Let's go ... Oh , the dance hall looks very nice and the music is wonderful . "
happy, How about going to dance ? There is a very good nightclub nearby . 
happy, OK . I hope so . 
happy, What do you suggest then ? 
happy, Very interesting ! 
happy,How is night life in Beijing ? 
happy," I got you . Their competitive edge lies mainly in endurance and stamina . They are creatures from the savannah , and take to running like antelopes . "
happy," Oh , sorry . I don't like them . Why not ask Lily . She likes modern dance . "
happy,I know you are a good dancer . What dances do you like ? 
happy, Special effects ? Baloney ! That movie was made on a shoestring budget . They've been using trick photography like that for years 
happy, I would say it was a typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood thriller . 
happy, Thanks again for buying the tickets . That was the most exciting live concert I've ever seen . That silver electric guitar was really cool . 
happy," Okay , see you then . "
happy," Yeah , that's the one I've heard the special effects and the plot are outstanding . "
happy, OK . I'll take one . 
happy, You mean the one starring John Travolta ? 
happy, How about that European movie ? 
happy, Sounds good . What should we see ? 
happy,"Hey , if you're not busy this weekend , would you like to go see a movie ? "
happy, Good idea 
happy, I guess it could happen . 
happy, How did you like the movie ? 
happy," Yes , l have two of her Cds , l'II lend them to you if you like . "
happy," Look , nice fresh cherries ! They are ripe and soft . I'll take some . "
happy, Sounds like an interesting film . Let's meet at five o'clock on Saturday . 
happy," Really , that's good . "
happy, Could you tell me some of entrees about the dinner ? 
happy," Yes , would you arrange it for me the day after tomorrow ? "
happy, Do you have many friends ? 
happy," Yes , my friends like to get along with me well . "
happy,"You are an outgoing person , quite easy to talk with . "

happy, Thank you.But does it really look all right ? 
happy,What a nice tie you are wearing ! 
happy," Oh , I'll try to catch it . "
happy, Yes.Look ! Mary is going to throw the bride bouquet . 
happy, Will Mary and her husband be ready to leave for their honeymoon ? 
happy," You are right , Mary's father is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . I think he must spend much money . "
happy," Mary's father is a rich man , isn't he ? "
happy," Yes , It's very great . "
happy," Hi.It ' s a wonderful wedding , isn't it ? "
happy, Yes.You look very smart today . 
happy, What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love things like this ? 
happy, That would be my pleasure . I'll wrap the perfume up in the gift box for you too . 
happy, Here you are . 
happy,"Happy Birthday , Mary ! "
happy, Same here . 
happy, That sounds good . I've missed you my friend . 
happy," Well , I'm not working on the weekend , so we could grab some beer , ice and our fishing rods , and head out to the river . "
happy, You have good taste . Let my show you what I have . 
happy," Yes , but I doubt if I get it . I've never get it . "
happy, That would be great . Thanks ! 
happy, Be sure to blow out all the candles in one puff . 
happy," Wow , what a lovely cake . "
happy,Here comes the birthday cake . 
happy, Thank you very much . 
happy," Coffee , please . "
happy, Maybe you are right . 
happy," She's doing great , she's getting her confidence back , and her self-esteem , has improved drastically.She ' s very happy . "
happy, After going through an episode like that I'm not surprised . How's her headspace ? 
happy, How about eight o'clock tomorrow morning ? 
happy, Yes . I haven't been in his house for several weeks.When shall we start ? 
happy, Shall we visit our math teacher tomorrow ? 
happy, No . I'm just killing time . 
happy, Just fine.Are you busy now ? 
happy," That sounds good . How are you doing , Linda ? "
happy," Great , I'll take one . "
happy, Would you like to talk over a drink ? 
happy," Wow , that sounds like a bargain . I'm running low on facial moisturizer and toner . Could you ring those up for me too along with the blush ? "
happy," She doesn't need to do that , I didn't do anything . "
happy, Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter . 
happy, Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? 
happy," Woo , your home will beautiful on Christmas . "
happy,"Nice and warm again , isn ’ t it ? "
happy, Oh . I ’ m sorry to hear that . What happened ? 
happy, Yeah . All of us tried our best . 
happy, Bob ! I hear your team won the match . 
happy,"Nice to see you , Patrick . "
happy," Thank you , David . "
happy," Have a nice journey , Lily . "
happy, I ’ m sure I will . 
happy, I ’ m sure you ’ ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country . 
happy, Thank you . I ’ m leaving tomorrow morning . 
happy, Congratulations . How lucky you are ! 
happy, You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ’ t have to pay for my trip . 
happy, Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations . 
happy, Yes . He ’ s already got the passport and visa . 
happy," He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ? "
happy, He is fine . 
happy, And how ’ s your brother ? 
happy, Thank you . 
happy, Congratulations on your success . 
happy, Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published . 
happy,"How are you , Sue ? "
happy, You ’ re right . 
happy, You often like comparing children with their parents . 
happy," Oh , it ’ s lovely . Think of the nasty weather we had last week . "
happy, How are you these days ? 
happy," Fine , thank you . And you ? "
happy, I ’ m a new student in the school . My name ’ s John . 
happy, I'm filthy rich ! Haven't you heard about the MicroPower deal ? 
happy," Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hi , Mary . How are you ? "
happy,"Is that you , Dave ? Oh , my gosh ! The backstabber who left us to work for the evil WebTracker ! "
happy," It's kind of cool , isn't it ? I'm sort of like a secret agent . "
happy, No kidding ! I can't believe this . You devil ! 
happy, No way ! That's great ! Then we'll still be together ! 
happy, You do ? 
happy, They're in awe of her . After they saw how she crushed WebTracker ... but I guess you know all about that . 
happy," Hi , Vince . Thanks for stopping by . How's the work coming along for the online auction ? "
happy,"Morning , Zina . Just wanted to say thanks again ! "
happy, Maybe . But I ‘ d rather be spoiled than turn into a crazy guy with a long period to talk to the birds . 
happy, It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . 
happy," Well . I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . But ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price . "
happy,"Good morning , Jason . How did you sleep ? "
happy," Ok , Jason . So how was the flight ? "
happy,Hello Gina ! We've spoken so many times on the phone but's it's so good to finally meet you in person ! 
happy, That's pretty tough ! 
happy,"OK , Devon , I've been putting on a few pounds and you're quite a lean fit guy . "
happy," Yeah , I'm going to be making phone calls all day . What a blast . "
happy, Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . 
happy," Yes , yes , I want to take you to dinner . "
happy, And a white sports car . 
happy," Well , I hope you ’ ll feel better soon . "
happy," Nice to meet you , John . "
happy," Pretty well , thanks . Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit , but last night I got at lease six hours of rest . "
happy," Well , children usually resemble their parents . "
happy," Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . "
happy," Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . "
happy," I see . I guess I should be more careful about what I read , especially on the Internet where you have no idea who anybody is . "
happy," It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . The person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him . "
happy," Okay , thanks a lot . You did me a great favor just now . "
happy, It ’ s 8357688 8 . 
happy, I know a mover which has a very good reputation for their service . I ’ ll leave you their phone number . 
happy," It makes sense , right ? Who else is going to eat it ? "
happy," Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first . "
happy, Uh ... what game ? 
happy," Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton with my husband . I always feel good afterward . "
happy," Oh , I see . You know , we spend time doing different sports . How much time do you spend exercising ? "
happy, You must have a wonderful time . 
happy,"Hi Amanda , how are you ? I've missed working with you and the whole gang since my transfer last week . "
happy," I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall . "
happy, Really ? I thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby . 
happy," They do , but it doesn't help too much . Having seven children means that the money situation in my home is always pretty tight . "
happy," Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn . "
happy, A house warming party ? 
happy, Sometimes they are too independent . 
happy," And if you try to find a part-time job , you'll have some money too . "
happy," Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me . "
happy," Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ? "
happy," Good , happy birthday to you ! "
happy," By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday . "
happy," Thank you , Paul . "
happy," Oh , what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it . He likes children and always wants a child of his own . "
happy," Yeah , I guess I did . They're going to buy invoking ? "
happy, We've missed you too . The office just isn't the same without you . How is your new job ? 
happy, What kind of house is it ? 
happy," And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does . "
happy, My first grandchild . 
happy,"I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! "
happy, Not only that . The job I ’ m doing now is the most boring job you can imagine . 
happy, I like him.He ' s good for her . 
happy," I think so.Yes , they get along so well . "
happy, It sure is . 
happy, You said it . 
happy, I suppose I do . 
happy," He kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion . "
happy, I'd like to come back next weekend . 
happy," Well , three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person . "
happy, You are absolutely right . 
happy, I couldn't agree with you more . 
happy, I really enjoy the beach in the summer . 
happy, My feelings exactly . 
happy,What a great weekend that was ! 
happy, She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time . 
happy," Right , congratulations . "
happy," Not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding . "
happy," No , it has three bedrooms and three beds , and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling . There ’ s a two-car garage . "
happy, And it ’ s a bargaining . A house like this in river side costs double the price . 
happy," Oh , I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses . "
happy, It ’ s a wonderful Spanish style . 
happy, We should come here more often . 
happy, Really ? Congratulations ! 
happy, That's right . For seventy-five million . So how are you ? 
happy, That's really a good thing . Let's do our part . 
happy, Cool . You must have been to a lot of places . 
happy, It means a hiker who loves traveling around the world . 
happy," Sure , come on in . "
happy, About 6 . 
happy," Julie ’ s friend , Mary . And John will be the best man . "
happy, How nice seeing the sun back again ! The air is so fresh . 
happy," Yes , it is.It ' s wonderful after the downpour . "
happy,"It's a fine day today , isn't it ? "
happy," Oh , no.On the contrary , there are many beautiful days , especially in the spring and fall . "
happy, Please look at the sky.Don ' t you see the dark clouds ? It's going to rain soon . 
happy," Yes , I did . "
happy, Obviously you did enjoy the concert . 
happy, Absolutely right.He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto.That caused a sensation.The audience were stunned by his pure tone . 
happy," Oh , I learned that he is also a legendary violinist . "
happy," Oh , speaking of the conductor , he is indeed a genius.He did a perfect job.His name is Menuhin , a descendent of Russian American immigrants . "
happy, Who was the conductor ? 
happy,I heard that you went to the concert the day before ? How did you like it ? 
happy," Oh , photography , It ’ s really a good hobby . "
happy, I like taking photos out of door . 
happy," Ok , see you . "
happy, Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty.OK ? 
happy, Sure.Thank you very much . 
happy, Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ? 
happy," Yes , actually almost half of all the countries over the world . I love traveling places . "
happy, I'll try my best . 
happy,You look great ! 
happy, Thanks to you . I'm totally pumped up . 
happy," He likes American Idol very much , and he always imitates the contestant at home . I can't believe he got on the stage himself . "
happy, My children would like that ; they like dancing very much . 
happy," Oh , I've forgotten to tell you . The party is held every other week . And every family gives their own performance each time . "
happy," I surely will . By the way , is the party like this held every weekend in our neighborhood ? "
happy, I've said you will enjoy your life here ! 
happy,"Hey , Shirley . The party has been wonderful . My husband and my children have enjoyed it very much , and me too . "
happy," Of course , all the workers here are able to swim , and they will come to your aid quickly . "
happy," Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ? "
happy," That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ? "
happy," OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it . "
happy," You should speed up , because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today . "
happy, Not bad . 
happy,"Hey , Daniel , how's it going ? "
happy," To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here . "
happy,"Look , daddy is on again . Don't you think he is handsome ? "
happy," That's the way to go . Now , you are flying , my boy . "
happy, Are you out of your mind ? 
happy," Boy , you've got such a crush on her , haven't you ? "
happy," Hey , young man ! I'm your sis . Don't talk to me like that . "
happy," Come on , 18 points already , they are never gonna catch up . "
happy, Don't be scared.Bite the bullet and everything will be right again . 
happy, How about giving them to that old man ? 
happy,Have we sold out all the newspapers for today ? 
happy," Oh , really ? "
happy," The seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they're already occupied by somebody else . "
happy," Yes , how are you doing ? "
happy, I've come to tell you I'm going to the concert this evening.Will you come with me ? I've two complimentary tickets . 
happy," I'm fine too , thank you . "
happy," Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry . "
happy," I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado ; but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day . "
happy," That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . "
happy, I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ? 
happy," Yes , the weather sure is nice today . "
happy,"It's a lovely day , isn't it ? "
happy," Look , is that Tom ? "
happy,"Lisa , I'm so glad to see you . How are you doing ? "
happy," well , I can ’ t just imagine it . "
happy," Yes , I like collecting things . "
happy,Do you have any hobbies ? 
happy, Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work . 
happy, Maybe one month . Just have a try first . Not too tough at the beginning . 
happy," Well , I am a bit out of shape . I'm thinking about getting some exercises to keep fit . "
happy, Here is the programme . Check it out yourself ! 
happy, Sure . That makes a good fan . Do you know what songs she is gonna sing tonight ? 
happy," You are right . Anyway , things will be different as the days go on . She can get it . I have faith in her . "
happy," Well , I suppose people have different tastes on music . Moreover , here stuff is really strong and creative . It takes time for people to accept new things . "
happy, But I also heard some people didn't like her music . I don't understand why . She is so amazing ! 
happy, She is a real star . Not a onetime thing . 
happy," Yeah . Though she was so popular , I heard she managed to maintain a low profile . "
happy, Me too . She is so young and talented . She is not only a singer but also a great composer herself . 
happy, Mendy ? Are you sure ? I love her songs ! 
happy," A lot of stars , including Andy , Justin , Mendy ... "
happy," Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal . "
happy," Oh , I forgot to tell you this . The show is to collect money for children in need . And all the money from ticket selling will go to the Red Cross . "
happy, Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month . 
happy, let ’ s go together . 
happy, Fine ! How are you ? 
happy,"Hi , Bob ! How are you doing ? "
happy," Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall . "

happy," Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . There's also a garden . "

happy," I think it will be very useful in many ways . Beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in China , but also in the world , English is useful in almost all walks of life . "
happy, And English is very useful in your job . 
happy," I think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there . "
happy, That ’ s a good idea . It must be easy to find a job in shanghai . 
happy," Oh , I ’ ll go to shanghai to practice there . "

happy, Absolutely right.He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto.That caused a sensation.The audience were stunned by his pure tone . 
happy," Oh , I learned that he is also a legendary violinist . "

happy, I'd be glad to tell you what I think . 
happy,"Betty , would you please read this letter of application I've just written ? I'd like to have your opinion . "
happy, There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ? 
happy,Which film shall we see ? 
happy, Please look at the sky.Don ' t you see the dark clouds ? It's going to rain soon . 
happy," Oh , no.On the contrary , there are many beautiful days , especially in the spring and fall . "
happy," I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado.but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day . "
happy," That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . "
happy, I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ? 
happy," Yes , the weather sure is nice today . "
happy,"It's a lovely day , isn't it ? "
happy," If I were you , I would change the beginning . You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities . "
happy," Well , I'm not sure of his name , but I know it's going to be his farewell performance . "
happy," Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ? "
happy, Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month . 
happy," Yes , it is.It ' s wonderful after the downpour . "
happy,"It's a fine day today , isn't it ? "
happy, Oh . I ’ m sorry to hear that . What happened ? 
happy," Well , I hope you ’ ll feel better soon . "
happy, Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ? 
happy, Not bad . 
happy," Yes , I like collecting things . "
happy,Do you have any hobbies ? 
happy, You yourself have a photo studio ? 
happy," I'm very well , thank you.How are you ? "
happy, Don't mention it . I am pleased to help you . 
happy," You're right , I'll change it . How about the last part ? "
happy,"Betty , would you please read this letter of application I've just written ? I'd like to have your opinion . "
happy, Today ? 
happy," Thank you , Mr.Smith . I'm returning to China today . "
happy, You're welcome . I'd like you to join us for dinner again sometime . 
happy,"How do you do , Mr.Smith ? This is Lili . I'm calling to thank you for the wonderful dinner we had yesterday . I enjoyed it very much . "
happy, That's something else ! Maybe I'll return it to them . 
happy, Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch . 
happy, How about Saturday morning ? 
happy, That's a good idea.What time is good for you ? 
happy,Do you want to go shopping with me ? 
happy, Don't forget to call us if you're in Tokyo . 
happy," Well , good-bye and have a good trip ! "
happy," Very good . But you should talk about your family , too . "
happy, My plane leaves at seven twenty-five . 
happy, Thank you . 
happy," If there's ever anything I can do for you , Don't hesitate to let me know . "
happy, Don't mention it . It was the least I could do . 
happy, It's most kind of you . 
happy, I'm glad I was able to help . 
happy,"Ma , I really don't know how to thank you . "
happy, That's right . 
happy," Very good . But you should talk about your family , too . "
happy," You're right , I'll change it . How about the last part ? "
happy," If I were you , I would change the beginning . You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities . "
happy, I'd be glad to tell you what I think . 
happy, I'm most grateful . 
happy," OK , just ignore him . I've noticed there are lots of exercise facilities in our community . After dinner you can go there for a walk with your family ! "
happy,When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ? 
happy, Don ’ t mention it . 
happy,"Joe , how are you doing ? "
happy, Great ! I'll look forward to it . We'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation . 
happy," Oh yes , everyone we are inviting is from our company . "
happy," Yes , you play the piano well . You could be a good pianist . That's good . "
happy, That sounds wonderful . Will there be anyone there that I know ? 
happy," Yes , we've invited four other couples , so it should be a good mix of people . "
happy, That sounds good . It will give my wife a chance to dress up . 
happy," Actually , we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays . "
happy, That sounds great . Is it casual ? 
happy, I've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home . 
happy," Yes , I think we might be free . What did you have in mind ? "
happy, That was part of my plan . 
happy, That would give us plenty of time to explore . Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara ? 
happy, I thought that we could leave around 8 
happy," Sure , I would love to go with you . When would you be leaving ? "
happy, Would you be interested in joining me ? 
happy, That sounds like a great idea ! 
happy, I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach . 
happy, That's my good girl . The clothes need washing . I'll do the laundry . 
happy, I am not sure . What are you doing ? 
happy, Dress casually and bring your bathing suit ! 
happy, I am assuming that the dress is casual . 
happy," Really ! Oh , honey , you are so sweet . I'll chop up this carrot . "
happy," Pretty good . Mary , I was wondering if you would like to come to a party on Friday night ? "
happy," I am free that night , and a party sounds good . "
happy, Fine . It will be at my house . Do you know how to get there ? 
happy," I kind of know where you live , but could you e-mail me your address ? "
happy, That's right . 
happy,"It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? "
happy, Really ? Thank you . 
happy, Fine . 
happy, How is everything going on ? 
happy,I'm so glad to meet you . 
happy, Yes . I graduated last year and got a job in a press . 
happy, Yes . I miss you very much . 
happy,"Hi , Linda . I haven't seen you for ages . "
happy, I am counting on being able to get a good job . 
happy," I have lemonade , iced tea , and mango juice . "
happy," We will be providing hot dogs , hamburgers , and cake , but people can bring side dishes . "
happy, Good ! I am really thirsty . You know it really is hot outside ! 
happy," Well , it is very beautiful . "
happy, About four years now . 
happy, How long have you lived here ? 
happy, We enjoy it too ! 
happy," Hi , Malia ! What a nice home ! "
happy,"Welcome , Ron , come on in ! "
happy," Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall . "
happy, Would you like some help with the food ? 
happy," Oh yeah , I remember Jake . That would be fine . "
happy," I would really like to bring my friend Jake , if that would be OK . "
happy, I can do that . Do you have anyone that you would like to bring with you to the party ? 
happy," Ron , have a seat and I'll get us something to drink . "
happy, Oh good ! Can I bring anything ? 
happy, We thought it would be fun to have a pool party at Jay's house . 
happy, That sounds like fun . Where will it be ? 
happy, It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city . 
happy," Yes , there is this beautiful view . you may go fishing , camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air . "
happy, There is a beautiful state park here . I can see why so many people come out here to camp . 
happy," No , thank you.It looks a bit too dangerous for me . "
happy,"What a beautiful view , my sweetheart ! "
happy," Although we have many things in common , we'are not soul mates . "
happy, Of course . 
happy, Great ! Do you know how to get there ? 
happy," What about Tianqiao Temple Fair ? A variety of opera performances , acrobatics shows , and food will dazzle you . "
happy, I just can't wait to see them . Which one do you choose today ? 
happy," Absolutely , I love temple fairs . Beijing has several temple fairs recently . They are different from each other to some extent , but also have a lot in common . "
happy, He's my brother . 
happy, Sounds interesting ! 
happy, Temple fair ? 
happy," Exactly . But later on , he cares more about his career than love . Work seems to be the better all , and all for him-so much that he doesn't even grudge sparing a day out with me . "
happy," Well , he is a typical Sagittarius guy , while I am a Cancer . We aren't really compatible "
happy," Good to meet you , Mr Chettri . "
happy," Oh , hello . I'm Bias Chettri . "
happy, I would recommend a day at the zoo . It's fun for all the family . There is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip . 
happy," I would recommend the mall , it's about 20 minutes , drive to the south in a taxi . It has a wide range of shops and restaurants . "
happy," My wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ? "
happy," OK , please . "
happy,"Excuse me , I'd like to ask you a few questions about the city . "
happy," Nice to meet you , Dolma . "
happy," Yes . The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth , and they have developed into a festival filled with food , performances and games now . "
happy,"It's a lovely day , isn't it ? "
happy," So that's how it is ! Now he ’ s in trouble , but I belive he will rise to his own feet again . "
happy, Really ? I'm not much of an outdoor person . What do you like about it ? 
happy, We are putting together a birthday party for Mary . 
happy, I didn't have any big plans . 
happy, So am I going to see you at the party ? 
happy," Wow , that does sound like it's going to be fun . "
happy," This party is going to have a DJ , food , and drinks . "
happy, How do you know it's going to be so fun ? 
happy, I was thinking about it . Are you ? 
happy, That sounds interesting . Have you been involved in any mystery ? 
happy, Well done ! I hope I can sing as well as you one day . 
happy, Thank you . I'm sure you will . 
happy, I hope so . Thank you for saying so . 
happy,"Mr . Lin , what are you interested in ? "
happy," I used to be an atheist . But in recent months , I couldn't but form a more favorable opinion of horoscope . "
happy, I have found myself a date mate . 
happy," Well , it's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock . Then drink a cup every half hour . It really works ! "
happy, Are you ready to welcome him ? 
happy, I like him very much . He ’ s a gay dog . 
happy,How do you like Tom ? 
happy, But it's unfair for Jane . 
happy, How about Joining our summer camp next week ? 
happy," Yes , but I threw them back . "
happy, Do you hike or fish on your trips ? 
happy, He has a really good voice ! 
happy," Yes , he sings wonderfully . "
happy, You must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun . 
happy, Hi . My name is Dolma . 
happy," Yes , the weather sure is nice today . "
happy," That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . "
happy, Yes . you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad.sometimes new food might disagree with you . 
happy," Yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of travelling in the city , I felt sick I think I had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening . "
happy, You must have had a great time . 
happy," Art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say . "
happy, What else did you see ? 
happy," Yes , that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitorsfrom all over the world taking photos there . "
happy, Did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower . 
happy," It was wonderful , but I was so tired . "
happy,"Hey Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ? "
happy," Well , it can't be helped . We'll just have to put up with it . "
happy, I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us . 
happy, What do you mean ? 
happy, Is it ? 
happy," Julie ’ s friend , Mary . And John will be the best man . "
happy," That ’ s really a shame . By the way , who will be the bridesmaid ? "
happy," Sure , you ’ re more than welcome . I ’ m meeting everyone at three o ’ clock . "
happy, Oh really ? I ’ ll come along with you if that ’ s ok . 
happy, At least more than 100 years old . 
happy, It must be old . 
happy, You're right . I love it very much . 
happy," Yes , it looks interesting . "
happy,Have you seen that house ? 
happy," Well , I need to polish up my English . "
happy," On the fourth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic . And no stomach problems . "
happy, That is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful . 
happy, Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ? 
happy,"Hello , Pam . "
happy," Yeah , I never thought we could be good friends either . We have our differences . She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed , but we still get along extremely well . We can talk for hours about anything . "
happy, Sounds a good weekend . You know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and Jo can become such close friends . 
happy, It must be interesting . 
happy," Yes , you're right . "
happy," Great . I hung out with Jo all day shopping , and the went out for dinner together . "
happy, Not bad . We had a get-together with friends from college . I haven't seen many of them since graduation . How about you ? 
happy, Good luck ! 
happy," You bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . "
happy," That's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? "
happy, Is she American ? 
happy,"It's a lovely day , isn't it ? "
happy," Ok great , I ’ ll see you at six . "
happy, He sure is ! 
happy, Who's that guy who's handing out beer to everyone ? 
happy, This is Alex . Remember ? This is Sean . 
happy, Do we need an appointment beforehand ? 
happy, Exactly . 
happy," Oh , ISEE . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . "
happy, I believe most of them think it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known . 
happy, Really ? What do the companies do that for ? 
happy, Good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ? 
happy, Yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry . 
happy, You mean visit a factory ? 
happy, They've gone out so that we could have the house to ourselves . 
happy, That's my boyfriend Matt . Isn't he cute ? 
happy, Let ’ s meet in front of the train station . 
happy, Ok that sounds good . Where shall I meet you ? 
happy, Good idea ! I finish work at five . Why don ’ t we meet at six ? 
happy, So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday . 
happy, We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan . 
happy, You were lucky then . What did you do after that ? 
happy," Sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . "
happy, Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ? 
happy," Tell me about it , will you ? "
happy,"Well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ? "
happy," It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day . "
happy,"John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? "
happy," Oh , everything comes back to life in spring and the weather gets warmer . "
happy, Why ? 
happy, Is it very interesting ? 
happy,Which season do you like best ? 
happy, Not bad thanks . 
happy," Hi Tom ! I'm fine , and you ? "
happy,"Good morning , Mei ! How are you ? "

happy,Good afternoon ! 
happy, If the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend.It ' s been a while since I've not really gotten some sun .

happy, Sure . I get a lot of information and make many friends . 
happy, You are welcome . 
happy,"Hello Mei , How about going for a meal this evening ? "
happy, You just turn a deaf ear when she talks . 
happy,Kata ! You've got a beautiful singing voice . You hit the high notes perfectly . 
happy, Thank you for your compliment . But you are exaggerating . I think you are destined to be a singer . You have the best voice ! 
happy, Thank you . Maybe we can sing a song together . Would you like to sing with me ? 
happy," Yes , I'd like to . It's my honor . Let's pick a song . "
happy, About 6:00 . 
happy, Very much.What time ? 
happy, Eighteen.Some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight.Do you want to come ? 
happy," Well , imagine that ! How old are you ? "
happy, Yes . 
happy," Oh . no . The motor coach is air-conditioned , there is a galley for food preparation , movies or music are available for your entertainment and attendants are there to take care of your every need . "
happy, Today ? 
happy,"Happy Birthday ! This is for you , Kate ! "
happy, Maybe . I'll have to ask my mother . 
happy, No problem . I'll tell you . 
happy, Really ? I'm so glad to hear that.But I don't know how to get access to the Internet.Could you show me ? 
happy," Well then , this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . I bet you'd love it . "
happy, Really ? I haven't heard of it . 
happy, Yeah . It seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned . 
happy," Hey , how would you like to taste my fist ? "
happy," That's funny , I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside . "
happy, No way . I will be scared out of my wits . 
happy, Thanks a lot . 
happy, Thanks.Miss Zhang . 
happy,Hello . I'm Jason .

happy, Problems are inevitable . 
happy, Try not to take on more than you can handle . 
happy, I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday . 
happy, Just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset . 
happy," For me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ? "
happy, Is it ? Mine is climbing mountains on Sunday mornings . 
happy, Thanks . 
happy, Goodbye and have a good flight . 
happy, I will . 
happy, Take care of yourself and remember to keep in touch . 
happy, It doesn't matter . 
happy, It's a pity that I'm too busy to see you off tomorrow .

happy," Oh , OK . I hear there's a terrific show at the Sanger Theater . "
happy," Oh . I like this one . I have been looking for this color and design . Please wrap it for me , and I ’ ll take it . "
happy," Oh , Diane and I went for a drive in the country on Saturday . "
happy," No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ? "
happy, You said it.Let ' s ask him to work in our bank .

happy,I'm dreadfully sorry for you . 
happy, Did you have fun there ? 
happy," Well , we went to a dance club . "
happy," Wow , your English is really fluent now . "
happy," No , because my English wasn't very good . I studied English for two years first . "

happy, That sounds nice . Where did you go ? 
happy," No , not much . In fact , nothing ever really happens . That's the trouble . "
happy, I will miss you .

happy,Can we have dinner together sometime this weekend ? 
happy, Thank you ! 
happy," Yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . Last year I went there . It's really . "
happy," I ’ Ve been to Qingdao before , so I ’ ll choose Dalian . I've heard that the environment there is very good . "
happy, Thanks . 
happy, That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian . 
happy, The seaside . 
happy, Where would you like to go ? 
happy," You know what , I've just got a new job with a computer company . "
happy, How about the second of March ? 
happy," No , I couldn't care less ! "

happy, We are ready to help you . 
happy, Much as I wish to but I really can ’ t . I've already booked the flight .

happy, That must be very beautiful . 
happy,Do you know how to go to the Fragrant Hills in Beijing ? I heard that they are very famous in China . 
happy," Not really , but I like watching . "
happy," If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money . "
happy, That ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work . 
happy," Well , that ’ s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money . "
happy, Next month . So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year .

happy,"Mary , it's good to see you ! "
happy," Oh , that's difficult to say . But I guess I liked Nashville the best . "
happy," So , what was the best thing about your trip ? "
happy," Yes , most of the time . But it snowed a lot in Chicago . "

happy, You ’ re a real friend in need . 
happy," When Jo and I are together , we argue a lot , but that's also part of the fun . Besides , I know she will always be there for me when I need her , and she knows I'll be there for her . "

happy," Fine , thank you . "
happy,How have you been ? 
happy, Thank you . 
happy, Is everything ready now ? 
happy," Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive . "
happy, Thank you for understanding . I promise I ’ ll make it up to you . 
happy, Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .

happy," I ’ m starving , too . There is a new Chinese restaurant close by . Do you want to go there for lunch ? "
happy, Not yet . And I ’ m really hungry now . 
happy, Thank you . 
happy, I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available . 
happy, That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception . 
happy," It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . "
happy," Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet . "
happy,You look pale recently . 
happy," Ok , good luck . See you "
happy," Yes , it's really amazing . I got to go now . I'm meeting with some other collectors . "
happy, There's a lot to share when you have a common interest . 
happy," Just think , in a few days , I'll be swimming and lying in the sun and just taking it easy . "
happy, You're lucky . It's hard to find a place to stay at the beach in August 
happy," Oh , I don't need to do that . I'll be staying with friends "
happy, Thanks very much .

happy, Big head ! 
happy," Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway . "

happy, Wow ! Is it a good car ? 
happy, I am happy . I just bought a new car . 
happy," Yes , of course . I can't go through a day without coffee in the morning . "
happy," He is tall and slim , fair-haired . "
happy, You'll see the world-famous magnificent waterfall . 
happy,"So you're traveling around the world , aren't you . "
happy, You're right . And I also meet many new friends while collecting stamps . 
happy," Well , every stamp has a story to tell . "
happy, Absolutely . Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world . 
happy, I believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right ? 
happy, It's certainly a popular hobby . I know a lot of people love stamps . 
happy," No , Frank . I'm much more interested in collecting stamps now . "
happy, So you don't travel a lot now ?

happy,Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? 
happy, How amazing ! 
happy, That's incredible . I can't believe it . 
happy," Excuse me , what did you say ? "
happy," Because ... oh , all right . You win . Let ’ s pay for them and go . "
happy, You often like comparing children with their parents . 
happy, It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . 
happy," Well , children usually resemble their parents . "
happy," Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . "
happy," Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . "

happy," Oh , thank you so much . "
happy,You ’ re all set now ?

happy, How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you . 
happy," Yes , I ’ m going to take a holiday tomorrow . "

happy, Come on . It ’ s no trouble at all . 
happy," No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there . "
happy, I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now .

happy, I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t . 
happy," I think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends , and then the right person will come along . "
happy, My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . 
happy, Thank you for the dance . 
happy, Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . ( the music has stopped ) 
happy," Oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ? "
happy, What's wrong with her . 
happy, How about tango ? 
happy, In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? 
happy, When did you learn to dance ? 
happy, You dance beautifully too . 
happy, You're dancing so well . 
happy, Don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself . 
happy, Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... 
happy," Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? "
happy, It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . 
happy,The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? 
happy, Nothing is to your satisfaction . 
happy, Do you like your current job ? 
happy, It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . 
happy," Come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . "
happy, She is expecting . 
happy, I ’ Ve a lot of paper work to do right now . I ’ m behind schedule . 
happy,"I passed all the tests , Mom . "
happy, Well done ! 
happy, That's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation ! 
happy," Oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car . "
happy," Yes.These were always so many people.After taking the subway during the rush hour , you'll envy sardines in their cans . "
happy, Really ? What did you think ? 
happy, You can take me to the bank if you want to . 
happy, Can I help in anyway ? 
happy, Thanks . But it's necessary for me to buy a TV set . 
happy, I can lend you some money . 
happy, The bank closes in 30 minutes and I need to cash a check . 
happy, Congratulations to you .

happy,What shall we do after the volleyball match ? 
happy, I wish I were a hero . 
happy, Well have a good time . Get me some autographs if you can . 
happy," Yes , I ’ m also going to watch the triple jump and the high jump . "
happy," Wow , that should be really exciting , especially with so many famous athletes there . "
happy," Yes , I should get there just in time for the women ’ s 400m relay . "
happy," It's an easy way to get hurt , let me tell you . "
happy," It's very dangerous , you know . "
happy, I wouldn't do it if I were you . 
happy, I see . 
happy, Great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days ! 
happy," Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . "
happy, Mrs . Thou ? 
happy, Not yet . But I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck . 
happy, How have you been ? 
happy, It's got to be almost a year now . 
happy, Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ? 
happy,Matthew ? Hi ! 
happy," We share the same bathroom , in other words . "
happy," Well , I hope it's comfortable enough for you . "
happy, Thank you again for all your help . 
happy, OK . Bon voyage and a safe landing . 
happy, That's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family . 
happy," Me , too . What did you have in mind ? "
happy," I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must . "
happy," I agree . They're very lovely , especially Huanhuan "
happy," Well , Brad from school asked me out just today . "
happy, It ’ s Asian fusion . I heard it ’ s delicious . 
happy, What kind of food do they serve ? 
happy, You can ’ t imagine what he is like now . 
happy, Oh I didn ’ t know you were married . 
happy, Thank you . My husband gave it to me . 
happy, Thanks very much . 
happy, You're welcome . 
happy,Oh that ’ s a lovely necklace . 
happy," Oh dear . Well , get well soon and try to be more careful in future . "
happy," Well , let ’ s go to the marathon tomorrow then ! We can just stand by the side of the road . "
happy, Then we've got to get going . 
happy, Oh I still haven ’ t managed to get any tickets . I ’ d love to see something though . 
happy," So you haven ’ t done much then , in Shanghai ? "
happy, That sounds great . Have you been to the top of the Pearl Tower ? 
happy, Yes I have . I ’ Ve been there three times in the past year . 
happy,Have you been to Shanghai before ? 
happy,How ’ s your trip going ? 
happy," There are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts . "
happy, Any other ideas ? 
happy, I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now . 
happy," Oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ? "
happy," The five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive . "
happy," Is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ? "
happy, Oh wow . How was it ? 
happy, You're welcome . Maybe next time we'll come to see you . 
happy, We would stay longer . but I've got to attend a meeting tomorrow morning . Thank you for your warm hospitality . 
happy, My pleasure.What a pity you have to leave so soon ! 
happy, Maybe we ’ ll meet some of the artists too . 
happy, Yes that might be a better idea . 
happy, Mmm ... Well we could go to that new art gallery instead . 
happy, Oh . That ’ s a pity . I thought that we might go hiking in the hills . 
happy," Yes , it must be used for grinding coffee beans . "
happy, You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him . 
happy," Yes , they are shy and gentle but very powerful . "
happy,Tim ’ s smiles are interesting . 
happy, And I need to stretch my legs now . 
happy, Don ’ t be sad . Everything will be fine . 
happy, Definitely not . The most important thing was we loved each other . 
happy, Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work . 
happy, That's the plan . 
happy,I've heard you're going to America tomorrow . I want to see you off at the airport . 
happy, That ’ s just the short in the arm we need . 
happy, The state of economy is starting to go up in our country . 
happy, What is it ? 
happy," Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . "
happy, I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . 
happy," Well , I ddin't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . "
happy," Oh , that's exciting . What's this guy like ? Is he hot ? "
happy, Not much . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight . 
happy,"Hey , Mary , what's up ? "
happy," Yeah , you are so lucky to have found each other . "
happy, Rough . Maybe you can do the most of the talking . 
happy, Please don't tell my mom . 
happy, I wish she wouldn ’ t regret for her decision . 
happy, It's hard to believe that we're really leaving . The past two weeks was like a dream . 
happy,It's very kind of you to come and see us off . 
happy, That would be wonderful . Thanks ! 
happy," Well , if you want we can go together sometime . Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way . "
happy, There's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight . 
happy," You are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes ' walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants along the street . "
happy," Oh yeah , I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here . "
happy," Oh , there is a supermarket not far from here . But there is also a tea house around the corner , where you can get tea , taste tea and get a tea set as well . "
happy, Thanks . Some tea would be nice . Chinese tea is great . I really like your tea set . Where did you get it ? 
happy, Would you like something to drink ? I've got tea and some grape juice . 
happy, Nice to meet you too . 
happy," Oh , hi Lucas , come on in . I'm Barbara . Nice to meet you . "
happy,"Well , everything is packed and ready to go . "
happy,"Hi , I'm Lucas , I just moved in next door . "
happy, Thank you ! I always tune to this program when driving . So what's your favorite program ? 
happy, Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . 
happy, Maybe we can come here again next summer . 
happy, If only we could eat there once more ! 
happy, I ate so much that I wasn't hungry until afternoon the next day . 
happy, Of course . That was the best pasta I've ever had . 
happy, Thank you so much . I'll try and catch that . 
happy, Do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street ? 
happy," Yeah , we would have been lost without the help of the locals . "
happy, And the people were so friendly ! 
happy," Yes . Just think the blue sky , sunshine , mouth-watering food , centuries-old castles - - "
happy, Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . 
happy," Come on . Dating is a part of young people's social life . Besides , you're sixteen already . "
happy, I'm glad that you see it that way . 
happy, Do you want to borrow my coat ? I have a black coat that would look smashing on you . 
happy,"Susan , good evening . Why are you so dressed up ? "
happy, Let ’ s go then . 
happy, Me too . I feel very thirsty as well . 
happy, What a good idea . I'm quite hungry . 
happy, Shall we go to a restaurant to celebrate ? 
happy, I certainly am . I would have been very disappointed if I hadn ’ t got them . 
happy, Wow . You must be very excited . 
happy, It sounds good . Could I go and see it myself ? 
happy," Yes , I'm very pleased . I've just got two tickets to see the Olympic opening ceremony . "
happy,"Hi Amy , you look very happy . "
happy, Good idea . I ’ d be very happy to go there . 
happy, I am on my way out to a New Year ’ s banquet . How do I look ? Is my make-up OK ? 
happy," Welcome ! Come in , please ! "
happy, Do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city ? 
happy," Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice ! "
happy," I think so . One minute I feel quite awake , and the next I feel very tired . "
happy, Excellent ! I like it ! When can I move in ? 
happy, Shall we go out tomorrow then ? 
happy, OK . 
happy," No , I haven ’ t got any plans . "
happy, What a pity . I wanted to go for a drink with you . 
happy, That's the point . We should walk into the nature and enjoy its beauty whenever we have time . 
happy, I think we should go out more frequently . The natural scenery can do us good . 
happy," The same to me . All the things here make me happy , the mountain , the water , the grass , the birds , the sunshine ... "
happy," Oh yes , I'm very interested in Chinese history so I ’ d like to visit the Summer Palace . "
happy," I feel as if I'm living in a different world , honey . "
happy, You look great . Your make-up is perfect . 
happy," No , the one you have on looks fabulous , especially with your hair like that . "
happy," Oh good , come in , please . "
happy, Why not ? It sounds great . 
happy, It's made from naturally frozen grapes . 
happy," Oh , what's that ? "
happy, Yes . You always have a good nose for wines . 
happy, The port is quite exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ? 
happy, Excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor . 
happy," Port , please . "
happy, Do you prefer brandy or ports . 
happy, Great . Sweet wines are my favorite . They always make a great finish to a decisions meal . 
happy, That's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines . 
happy, Do you think I should wear a different dress ?

neutral, It's really cold . It snowed all day and the school closed early . 
neutral, What's the temperature ? 
neutral, It's 20 degrees below zero now . It was even colder this morning . 
neutral," Yes , we will . "
neutral, Aright . See you there . 
neutral, We will fine you if you damage it . 
neutral, I'll buy it if forty . 
neutral,How are you doing ? 
neutral, I'm doing great . 
neutral, What movies have you seen lately ? 
neutral, I saw Forrest Gump the other day . 
neutral," No , thanks . I ’ Ve had plenty . "
neutral, Shall I make more sandwiches ? 
neutral, What type of movie is that ? 
neutral, The movie type is drama . 
neutral, I can't believe you are watching movies . The weather is great . You should be outside . 
neutral," Yes , please . That is very kind of you . "
neutral, I hate the hot weather . I'd rather stay indoors with the air conditioner . 
neutral, What else do you like to do besides watching movies ? 
neutral," I like to play computer games , read books , go shopping , and play pool . "
neutral, Out of those what is your favorite ? 
neutral, My favorite is to play computer games . 
neutral, What is your favorite computer game ? 
neutral, I am on a diet . Do you have a vegetarian menu ? 
neutral," My favorite is Diablo . It used to be Star Craft , but it is getting a little old . "
neutral," If you like to play so much , when do you ever exercise ? "
neutral, Is this one fit for you ? It is nice . 
neutral, Don't worry about it . Try to look on the bright sight of things . 
neutral, Then why are you wearing black shoes ? 
neutral," That's pretty good . By the way , what are you doing next Saturday ? "
neutral," Well , why not try Spaghetti Bolognese ? "
neutral," Come here , please . "
neutral, I want to buy a hat . 
neutral," Hey , thanks , mum . "
neutral,Can I help you ? 
neutral, It ’ s as easy as pie . I always follow recipes . 
neutral, Perfect . I'll see you in front of the apartment at eleven thirty . 
neutral, I don't like the style . 
neutral, How about this one ? 
neutral, Do you know what time it starts ? 
neutral, He prefers suits to jackets . 
neutral," Judge from his look , he's a very serious person . "
neutral," As a matter of fact , he is . "
neutral, I will . 
neutral,Hello ? 
neutral, You ’ ll need to take care of the video . 
neutral, Hi Steve . This is Mike . What are you doing ? 
neutral, I have it right here . 
neutral," Oh , hi . I was just watching TV . "
neutral, I ’ m going to need your library card . 
neutral, Just the video . 
neutral, There's nothing to watch right now . 
neutral, How about forty-five ? 
neutral, It's too expensive . Can you come down a little ? 
neutral,May I help you ? 
neutral,All right . But these are black and I don ’ t like black shoes . They ’ re dull . 
neutral, Fifty yuan . 
neutral, Yeah . Let's plan something tomorrow . 
neutral, I also need to check out this video . 
neutral, Do you need anything else ? 
neutral," You must like this pink one , don't you ? "
neutral, Black is not my favorite colour . 
neutral, That's great . We can do something outdoors then . 
neutral, Are there any special events going on tomorrow ? 
neutral, I ’ m returning a book . 
neutral,May I help you ? 
neutral," Well , black is a better color than pink . Pink ’ s for girls . "
neutral,"Good morning , Loans . "
neutral, Yeah . I think there's a live outdoor concert by the river tomorrow . 
neutral, Oh yeah . I heard about that too . Let's go check it out . 
neutral, This is all you want to check out ? 
neutral, You need to apply for a passport . 
neutral," Have you heard about our special promotion this month ? If you purchase at least 200 yuan in any loreal products , you will receive this black hand bag with a sample of blusher , mascara and two shades of eye shadow . "
neutral, When can I apply for it ? 
neutral," Well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . No one would like to stay in the open air for long . "
neutral," That's true . In summer , the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool . "
neutral," So you'll make the Stars.com deadline , and have us up and running next week ? "
neutral," I myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects , especially the singing of cicadas . "
neutral," In autumn , almost all fruits are ripe and all crops are waiting to be harvested . "
neutral, And you can hear singing and laughing everywhere ! People are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity ! 
neutral," Well , winter is a season for relaxation , do you agree with me ? "
neutral," Well , it's hard to say . For the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , I think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year . "
neutral," It'll be close , but we'll make it . "
neutral, Come on ! Don ’ t be silly ! 
neutral, Maybe you are right . 
neutral,"What are your hobbies , Mr . Green ? "
neutral, That ’ s great . Thank you . 
neutral, I like collecting stamps . 
neutral," But it's an expensive hobby , isn't it ? "
neutral," Yes , you're right . What do you like to do in your spare time ? "
neutral, I usually play chess with my friends . But I like playing basketball best . 
neutral, Do you play basketball well ? 
neutral," Good . After Stars.com starts paying us , we won't need Vikam's cash anymore . "
neutral," And if we don't need them , we won't need Zina , either . "
neutral, Are you renting it alone or with company ? 
neutral, I prefer a one-bedroom apartment . 
neutral,Do you think what I did to Elvin was out of line ? 
neutral," OK , that'd be very nice . "
neutral,"Hey , Mary , what's up ? "
neutral, Do you have any particular type of apartment in mind ? 
neutral," Oh , that's exciting . What does this guy look like ? Is he hot ? "
neutral, Good morning . I'm calling to ask if you have a vacant apartment . 
neutral, It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? 
neutral, Women in particular . They are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress . 
neutral," I hate to admit it , but they're good . And fast . The Filipino kid is a genius . "
neutral,"In spring , people are feeling refreshed . They take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps . They feel they are full of spirits and energy . "
neutral, Twelve . He's very sensible for his age . 
neutral, How lovely it is ! 
neutral,I'm sure he was off-side . 
neutral, I don ’ t see it on the shelf . 
neutral, But the ref didn't whistle . 
neutral, Is there something wrong ? 
neutral, I fell down and hurt my arm . 
neutral, I think he favors the host team . 
neutral, I ’ m looking for this book . 
neutral," Anyway , the host team seems to fight for the gold . "
neutral,Do you need help with something ? 
neutral,Hey . Owen ! Have you gone on your family vacation yet ? 
neutral," Oh , yes . I got so tired . My son began to cry the moment we got on the train . It was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep . "
neutral, Didn't you bring his favorite toy ? 
neutral," Yes , we did . Fortunately we put his Teddy Bear in the bag , and finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms . "
neutral, It ’ s true . But I can ’ t show my abilities . 
neutral, Where did you go ? You've got a beautiful tan . 
neutral," By the way , how's the nose ? Boy , that must have hurt . "
neutral,I just had a terrible week . 
neutral, You must have had a great time . Most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming . 
neutral,How are Zina's new programmers working out ? 
neutral," Yes , he was every excited to see the blue sea and picked up many seashells to give as gift for his classmates in kindergarten . "
neutral, His friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir . 
neutral," And I taught him how to swim in the sea . It was fun and made him braver than before . After we returned home , he wasn't afraid to sleep alone in his bedroom . "
neutral, Your present job is something better . Why do you change ? 
neutral,Which team has won ? 
neutral, Neither . The game ended in two all . 
neutral, But I still think AC milan's defence seems better organized . 
neutral, I'll share it with one of my friends . What ’ s in a one-bedroom apartment ? 
neutral,I like the kid . He's so lovely . 
neutral, How old is he ? 
neutral," My wife didn't like to go to amusement parks , so we compromised and finally went to the seaside . I think vacation in summer is not good . "
neutral," Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would say honesty . "
neutral, You could have tried to explain to him about the new programmers . 
neutral, I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . 
neutral," I intended to , but as far as I know , all the skirts of this kind here are of the same size . "
neutral," Yes , you could if it's kept intact . But don't you want to get a bigger size ? "
neutral, Sure . At what time ? 
neutral," Well , I bought this skirt here yesterday afternoon . But I got the wrong size . It ’ s too small for my daughter . I wonder if I could refund it . "
neutral, Yes . Can I help you ? 
neutral,"Steven , I am ready for breakfast . "
neutral, OK . I will follow your advice . 
neutral," As a matter of fact , you are really a terrific photographer . "
neutral, Good gracious . That ’ s incredible ! 
neutral, When will my passport be ready ? 
neutral,Hey Mark . What are you doing ? 
neutral, I will need to take your passport picture . 
neutral, Just watching some TV . 
neutral, Anything interesting on ? 
neutral, OK . But where is my favorite coffee ? 
neutral, Not really . Just watching the sports highlight on ESPN . 
neutral, Just killing time until I find something to do . What are you going to do ? 
neutral, It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing . What's wrong with us ? 
neutral, You wanna shoot some hoops ? 
neutral," I already tried to call up some of the guys , but they are all busy . "
neutral, What ’ s next ? 
neutral, Where's your girlfriend ? I thought you were going out with her today . 
neutral," Fill this out , please . "
neutral,Excuse me ? 
neutral, I ’ d like to do that . 
neutral, That ’ s all . 
neutral, Aright . Do you have any cigarettes ? 
neutral," I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . "
neutral, I'd be glad to . Do you need anything else ? 
neutral, You can apply right now . 
neutral, So I take it you're pretty bored too . 
neutral, It looks like some kind of mistake . 
neutral,What do you like to do in your spare time ? 
neutral, What ! ? It'll be a miracle if we're ready by the end of the month ! Is she crazy ? 
neutral, Elvin doesn't want any programming help . He wants all the glory for himself . 
neutral," Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . "
neutral," That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ? "
neutral,What do you like to do in your spare time ? 
neutral," I am a girl of many interests . I like dance , chess , collecting stamps , travelling and taking photos . "
neutral, What kind of dance do you like ? 
neutral, You might be right . He does think pretty highly of himself . 
neutral,Good morning . Venus Real Estate Agency . 
neutral," Please hold on , I'll just check with the delivery department . "
neutral," Well , I'm hosting a dinner party this weekend . Couldn ’ t you make it any sooner ? "
neutral," OK , I will try . As for stamp , don't you think it is an expensive hobby ? "
neutral, I ’ m terribly sorry about that . We could take it back and deliver a new one to you early next week . Would that suit you ? 
neutral, Did you hear the names he was calling me ? 
neutral," Hello , I ordered a dining table last week . The order arrived today , but there are several scratches on the surface of the table . I would like to exchange it . "
neutral, That's what friends are for . 
neutral, Sounds pleasant . 
neutral, I heard . But did you have to tear out his nose ring ? 
neutral,There's just one catch . Zina asked me to let you know . 
neutral,My goodness ! You ’ re kidding ! 
neutral,"Hello , Pauline ’ s Furniture Store , Faye speaking . How may I help you ? "
neutral," He is tall and slim , fair-haired . "
neutral, Never mind . It ’ s just my duty . 
neutral, He is a nice guy and very considerate . I am impressed with how smart he is and he has a great sense of humor . 
neutral," Oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? "
neutral, What ? 
neutral," He didn't say , but he said he would call me . "
neutral, Maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! 
neutral," Oh , David . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What should I do if he doesn't call me ? "
neutral, Sorry to have given you trouble . 
neutral," Are they ? In that case , I'll be glad to give your money back . "
neutral,"Mary , how was your date with john ? "
neutral," I think it's soon , maybe in a few months . It was renewed in Beijing , so the new expiry date is on the last page . "
neutral," Does the class start again , Mam ? "
neutral, Ok . I'll talk to you later . 
neutral," Dear , forgive me . I won ’ t do that again . "
neutral," What time is it , please ? "
neutral, Do you think Bruce Willis just drank a Coke for his health ? 
neutral," I am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc . "
neutral," Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ? "
neutral," Thank you , Paul . "
neutral,"You saved my life yesterday , Rachel . I can't believe I forgot to bring my wallet when we went to lunch with those clients . "
neutral, That ’ s too much . 
neutral, True . True . 
neutral,That dog has white long hair . It ’ s lovely . 
neutral, It was a good thing I had enough on me . 
neutral," Well , it does have a lot of girls in it . "
neutral, Let me buy you lunch today to pay you back . 
neutral,"Hi , my name is Pete . You are Ann . Isn't that right ? "
neutral,"Saying you want to kill yourself , you terrified me out of my wits . "
neutral, A well-learned person never does that . 
neutral, She is my dog . I like her very much . 
neutral,Mark is parade his knowledge again . 
neutral, Why are we watching it anyway ? 
neutral," Daniel , carrots contain much Vitamin C . It is good for you . "
neutral, What ’ s her name ? 
neutral, He was so rich in the past . Maybe he ’ s regretting his past mistakes now . 
neutral," Hi Pete , how do you know my name ? "
neutral, Do you see that girl in the red top ? She told me who you were . 
neutral," Oh Andrea , the Spanish girl ? "
neutral, That black sheep . It serves him right . 
neutral," Yes , that's her . "
neutral," I know , but chocolate cake is even better . "
neutral, Yeah . We ’ re never going to get to the end of this one . 
neutral, Pardon ? 
neutral,Could you tell me the time ? 
neutral, Super ! 
neutral," So many dishes . Next Friday week is my birthday . I would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , OK ? "
neutral, How many hours do you work each day now ? 
neutral, That ’ s too bad . Is there a desk in the living room then ? 
neutral, What do you mean ? 
neutral," 12 hours , including 5 hours overtime . "
neutral,Mary is really a diligent girl . 
neutral, There is a desk and two chairs . 
neutral, That's tough indeed ! Do you think your health can afford ? 
neutral, I don't care . I need money . 
neutral," Surely you'll be paid extra for overtime , but do you think it's really worth ? "
neutral," Yes , I think so . When I work overtime I'm paid time and a half . "
neutral," Oh , yes . Money comes faster in that way than otherwise . "
neutral, But jobs with a lot of overtime are quite limited . Employers usually don't like to pay for overtime if they can manage . 
neutral, That's true . 
neutral, Of course . 
neutral," I met her last week at a party . Anyway , you must be from the United States ? "
neutral,Want to join me for a midnight snack ? I need to grab something to eat . 
neutral," Yeah , maybe you're right . How about this outfit ? "
neutral, He ’ s doing fine . A new broom sweeps clean . 
neutral,Our major is from a bigger city . 
neutral, Don't you think it's a bit bright ? 
neutral," Yes , I did . He only takes side with him . He seldom asks what Dick is doing . "
neutral, But didn ’ t you say that his Dad takes him under his wings ? 
neutral, I'd love to try some snacks . 
neutral, ( Later .. ) Everything looks tempting . What do you want to have ? 
neutral," He never does , and in fact , he seldom communicates with him . "
neutral," Does he do that with his Dad ? I mean , does he complain things to his father ? "
neutral,"Alright , tell me what you think about this one . "
neutral,"The trouble is not that . It is that he may suddenly remember something I promised him a couple of weeks ago , out of a clear blue sky . Then he complains that I have gone back on my words . "
neutral, Why not ? It is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking . 
neutral, Really ? Did Coke pay him for that ? 
neutral, Where are the chairs ? 
neutral," Actually I live in London , but my family lives in Seattle . "
neutral," Oh , I am from London as well . "
neutral, Where in London do you live ? 
neutral,I seldom heard the quarreling of her children . 
neutral, Sorry . How far is the museum ? 
neutral, Oh look ! Here it comes now ! 
neutral, I am not sure . We will ask for directions in the coffee shop . 
neutral, Here we are . You find us a table and I'll get the drinks . 
neutral," Yes , my customers have started to complain too ! "
neutral," Yes , me too . I think I ’ Ve lost some important clients recently because of this train ! "
neutral,Would you like to come over for dinner tonight ? 
neutral," Sure , but I have to tell you that I've become a vegetarian . I don't eat any kind of meat . "
neutral, When did you decide to become a vegetarian ? 
neutral, Her name is Fluffy . She is a sweet dog . 
neutral, That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much . 
neutral, That's great . Do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now ? 
neutral," Definitely . I've also been buying organic fruit and vegetables , which is more expensive , but much better for you because they don't have any pesticides on them . "
neutral, Why do you say that ? 
neutral," Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty . "
neutral, How do you get enough protein in your diet ? 
neutral," Well , I eat a lot more tofu , beans , nuts and some fish . "
neutral," No , I ‘ Ve been waiting for ages . "
neutral,Has the train come yet ? 
neutral," Well , don't worry about dinner . I'll only make vegetarian dishes for you . Do you like sushi ? "
neutral," I prefer cooked fish to raw fish , but if you really like it , make it . "
neutral, Maybe you are right . 
neutral, I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ? 
neutral, That sounds great . What time should I come over ? 
neutral, You don ’ t know that I have been over-protected by my mother these years . I am really about to leave the family and spread my wings . 
neutral, It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? ! 
neutral, What ? How happy you life is ! I do envy you . 
neutral," Yeah , that ’ s what I told her . I ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own . "
neutral, Sounds good . See you there ! 
neutral, I guess you could say that . Eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy . I've lost 5 pounds and I feel great ! 
neutral, She is really something . 
neutral, Because her children have been the age when they seem to quarrel all day long . 
neutral, She is a clever mother . 
neutral, It's OK . Please have a taste of it . 
neutral,Peter is a bag lady now . 
neutral, He was very clever when he was a boy . 
neutral, He is really terrific ! 
neutral," His mother , not me , should do this . "
neutral, I have the same idea as yours . 
neutral,Have you a wine list ? 
neutral, That would be lovely . But now let's go and get a drink . 
neutral, But you should at least consider your son's future . 
neutral," Yes , the wine list is at the end of the menu . "
neutral, Selfishness is one human beings instincts . It is very difficult to get it out root and branch . 
neutral,I wish you would not be so selfish . 
neutral, I feel the same way . 
neutral,"Dad , where are we off to ? "
neutral," Oh , I see . She told me that she had learned very quickly how to pour oil on troubled waters , but not to pour oil on the flame . "
neutral, First we will go to the city centre and stop for something to drink . Then we will visit the University Museum . 
neutral," Oh , stop it ! You know you need vegetables . You will end up fat if you don't watch your diet , now . "
neutral, I feel he's like a talking machine . 
neutral, There is a coffee shop round the corner . Can you see that big building at the end of the road ? 
neutral," The lecturer is dull , too . "
neutral,I don't think the lecture is very interesting . 
neutral, He ’ ll finish writing in a minute . 
neutral, Yes ? 
neutral, No . The teacher is dragging the chalk over the blackboard . It set my teeth on edge . 
neutral, Are you sick ? 
neutral,I feel so uncomfortable . 
neutral, That is a bank . The coffee shop is opposite the bank . 
neutral, Good . I will have hot chocolate . 
neutral, A stop ! Wait for the lights to turn green . 
neutral, When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you . 
neutral, Where are we going to have a drink ? 
neutral,Are you saying you saw an eagle ? There are no eagles here . 
neutral,What are you thinking about ? 
neutral, Nothing important . I've been working overtime lately . 
neutral, Maybe I want an apple pie . 
neutral, Take care ! Don't slip down to the ground . 
neutral," Oh , it's nothing to speak of . "
neutral,Your knowledge of English is really surprising . 
neutral," Yes , sir ! What can I do for you ? "
neutral, Sure . Wait a moment . 
neutral,"Boy , come here ! "
neutral," No , it is a fortnightly . So , you see , I can get the new one quite soon . "
neutral, You should feel shameful for your behavior . 
neutral," That would be very kind of you . By the way , is it a monthly magazine ? "
neutral, The fragrance of plum blossoms comes from the hard coldness . 
neutral, OK . 
neutral,What part did you get in the play this time ? 
neutral, I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior . 
neutral, I got a character part — some old lady who shows up in a few scenes . 
neutral,Is there a sofa in the living room ? 
neutral, But don't forget you are in a cafe . 
neutral, Are you kidding ? You got the leading role . 
neutral," I know , but I've done that so Ay times . It's getting old . The leading guy is always the same macho A . "
neutral, No foot gives out scent . 
neutral,"Bob , put on your shoes , your feet are really smelly . "
neutral, I would trade you if I could but I don't think I'd be a very convincing macho A . 
neutral, Next time . You are going to love your part . I've seen the script . 
neutral, I'm not at all keen on this subject . 
neutral,Can I borrow this magazine from you ? It's really interesting and I can't put it down . 
neutral, Yep . Here it is . What do you think ? 
neutral, That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ? 
neutral, Don't you like to know anything about stocks ? 
neutral," A light brown suit and a pink tie today , and a light blue shirt and a blue tie yesterday . A perfect match ! "
neutral, What a heavy snow ! 
neutral, Seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? That's a good idea . Let's go ! 
neutral," Bring me a cup of coffee , please . "
neutral, Will you have it strong or weak ? 
neutral," She would be laughing one moment , and if I said something insensitive , she would start crying . I didn't want to deal with that . "
neutral, 241 Main street . 
neutral, She sounds very emotional . 
neutral, It's a good idea . 
neutral," She was a psycho , man . One time we were suppose to get together . I was waiting for her call , and when she finally called , she was screaming why I wasn't at her place . "
neutral, Were you suppose to be there ? 
neutral, I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping . It was a misunderstanding . She was literally screaming on the phone over this . 
neutral, Ok . You're right . She's a psycho . 
neutral, I want a Hamburger and ice cream . What about you ? 
neutral, I'm just glad it's over . 
neutral,Won't you have some of this ? 
neutral," Oh , don ’ t talk to me about last night ! It was the most awful evening I ’ Ve ever had . "
neutral, I don't like Hamburgers . They have no taste . 
neutral, Really ? How did you get the chance ? 
neutral, The tie is necessary for man . It makes you look so attractive in a super tie . 
neutral, You'd better cool yourself down first . 
neutral, Don't be so angry . It's passed anyway . 
neutral,It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck . 
neutral, What about cheese cake or apple pie ? 
neutral, Why ? What happened ? 
neutral," Well . Mary had promised to be my date , but she stood me up . I waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind . "
neutral, Why don't you ask your husband to help you with it ? 
neutral, I prefer strong . 
neutral,I spend all my time looking after my baby . I'm so tired . 
neutral," It was boring . The music was too slow and the food was lousy and , above all , I was really sick of the same old crowd all the time . "
neutral, What do you think I should do about it ? 
neutral, So how long did you stay ? 
neutral, I left after the opening dance . I couldn ’ t wait to get out of there . 
neutral, Thank you . I appreciate the compliment . 
neutral,Do you like plum blossoms ? 
neutral, I can't forget it . 
neutral," Match is important ; well , the way of tying is also important . "
neutral, He's endless talking about stocks almost bores me to death . 
neutral, I am afraid there isn ’ t . 
neutral," The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period . Look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now . "
neutral," Yes , they are different ! But it's too professional . What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake . Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin ? "
neutral, Our relationship . I mean my friend and I ... 
neutral, Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . We can judge it with naked eyes . 
neutral," I see . By the way , China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . Did they issue their own coins in China ? "
neutral," Certainly , they did . Liao Coins and Song Coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe . Let me look for one and show you . "
neutral," If you happen to find one , please bargain with the owner for it . I'd like to have one . It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal . "
neutral,Hey Jackie . What are you doing ? 
neutral, Nothing much . I'm just relaxing today . Why ? What's going on ? 
neutral, Sure . 
neutral, I was thinking about heading to the mall . Do you want to go ? 
neutral, What is over ? 
neutral,It ’ s over . 
neutral, You are really a wet blanket . 
neutral, Any reasons ? 
neutral, Again ! 
neutral," How about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ? "
neutral, That sounds great . Where should we meet ? 
neutral," I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It's too plain on its own . "
neutral, Sounds good . See you there . 
neutral," That dress looks lovely on you , but it's not very practical , is it ? "
neutral, They're cute . But do you think you'll wear them much ? 
neutral, No . Not really . 
neutral, This sweater is so pretty . I love the low neck design . 
neutral, I bet it's expensive . 
neutral, It's on sale for $ 80 . What do you think ? Should I try it on ? 
neutral, For 80 bucks it looks great . Go try it on . 
neutral, About my boyfriend . 
neutral," Yeah , Got a Coke ? "
neutral,"Mark , you've been coming home late these days . What are you busy doing ? "
neutral, Are they having a sale ? 
neutral, You want something to drink ? 
neutral," How can you tell the difference ? From what I see , they look almost the same . "
neutral,"Look , here're two coins named Kai Yuan Tong Bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . These two coins were made in different periods of the Tang Dynasty . "
neutral," My father dose not know how to tie a tie , for he often wears a cravat . "
neutral," My father wears a tie every day , but he can ’ t do it himself . My mother helps him with his tie every morning . "
neutral,Mr . Smith is really a thorough drag . 
neutral, You mother is not only a patient mother but also a gentle wife . 
neutral, Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home . 
neutral, It was a real red letter day for you . 
neutral,What is that you have there ? 
neutral, Aah ! Close your eyes . You aren't supposed to see this . 
neutral,My son came home from three years in the navy . 
neutral, Ah ha ! I caught you . Just let me peek . I won't tell anyone . 
neutral, Perhaps . I'm dead tired . 
neutral, How much is the cancellation fee ? 
neutral, You can't peek ! This is a surprise . 
neutral,Did you hear what she said to me ? 
neutral, The cause is another boy . 
neutral, How about one little hint ? 
neutral," Here's one little hint . If you don't go out right now , this won't be under the tree . "
neutral, That's a very good hint . 
neutral, And please shut the door and lock it behind you ! 
neutral,Do you have a family tradition at Christmas time ? 
neutral, We have so Ay ! But my favorite happens at Christmas Eve . 
neutral, What is it ? 
neutral," Well , all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the Christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids . "
neutral," No , no , I'm just thinking of some dessert . And I have had enough carrots . "
neutral, That's it ? That's the tradition ? 
neutral,"I'm busy year in and year out , but now I've done nothing . "
neutral, Thanks . 
neutral," Well , in fact it's fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing . "
neutral, I guess the spirit of it is what really makes any tradition fun . 
neutral, You should be there some Christmas Eve . 
neutral," I may have done a lot , but none is to my satisfaction . "
neutral, What do you mean ? 
neutral, That ’ s a good idea . The counselor is a psychologist . He ’ s better trained to handle these sorts of things . 
neutral, You must have seen some other kind of bird . 
neutral, Don't tell me anything about it . I want to read it for myself . 
neutral, I see . 
neutral, He took the picture when he was only 21 years old . 
neutral, Okay . But be prepared for an all-nighter ! I doubt you will want to put it down either . 
neutral," Oh , I can't believe it.He looks very young . "
neutral, Really ? What a shame ! I thought she was going to win this one . 
neutral," Me , too . I'm sure she'll do better in the next tournament . "
neutral,It seems like it rains every time we plan a picnic . 
neutral,This man looks very handsome.Is he married ? 
neutral, That's a good idea ! 
neutral, Sounds great ! Shall I learn the actions that Jet Li did in the movies ? 
neutral, But I'll miss the news.It ' s important in my business to keep up with events in China . 
neutral," Well , that's life . "
neutral, How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? 
neutral," I know you're right , but what can I do ? "
neutral," Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing.And skipping meals will not help you lose weight.In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . "
neutral," But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter . "
neutral,I'll participate in a quiz about the 29th Olympic Games in Beijing . It will be held tonight . Will you come ? 
neutral, That is just an excuse.You can always find some time to exercise . 
neutral," Sure . What do you know about the Olympic Games on the past ? For example , do you know where and when the first Olympic Games were held in the ancient times ? "
neutral, It was held in 776 B . C . at Olympia . It also has a long history of more than 2700 years . 
neutral,I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise . 
neutral, Haven't the Olympics been stopped for a long time ? 
neutral," Yes , there were no games in 1916 , 1940 and 1944 , because of World War I and World War II . "
neutral," I see . Look , do you know what that emblem means ? I've seen it so many times , but I don't know what it stands for . "
neutral," Oh , it's the Beijing 2008 Olympics ' Emblem . It's a Chinese seal , meaning that Chinese people warmly welcome the friends from all over the world . "
neutral, I see . I believe there will be lots of foreigners coming to Beijing to watch the Games . 
neutral, You have no idea how proud I am of myself . 
neutral, Good ! 
neutral, Yes . I'm in the last chapter now and it is just gripping . 
neutral," I'd love to ! But I have never learned martial arts , and there is only a month left before the New Year . "
neutral, No problem . 
neutral," Well , would you please clean the livingroom ? You know I'm too busy . "
neutral,You seem to be very hesitant about doing things . 
neutral, It is still a mystery to me . 
neutral, How could you manage to pass the exam ? 
neutral,"Hello , is that the Peace Restaurant ? "
neutral," And then , after the floors are done , we can start to move our furniture in . "
neutral," To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course I'ever had . "
neutral, What are we waiting for ? Let's go ! 
neutral,I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? 
neutral, I am preparing a birthday party for Julia . 
neutral, But he has to stick to it and to it long enough . 
neutral," And he himself is very diligent . Considering all these , I think he has the ball at his feet . "
neutral," Oh , through a lot of hard work , of course . "
neutral,He has so many friends supporting him . 
neutral," I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ? "
neutral," Hmm Maybe you're right . But I can't stand all this green carpet here . And besides , I know how to paint . I will just cover everything with drop cloth . I won't get anything on the floor . "
neutral, That would be great . 
neutral, You mean you didn't know much English then ? 
neutral, Right . I only knew a few English sentences . 
neutral, That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ? 
neutral," First , I worked as a servant . "
neutral, Really ? I wish you could tell me more about your experience . 
neutral," I'd like to , but I must run to a meeting . "
neutral, Can I be of any help to you ? 
neutral, Yes . But we should hire someone for that . That will probably be expensive . And it has to be done right . 
neutral, Absolutely not . We can remove the carpet ourselves . Carpet is held down with carpet nails . You just need to pull it hard and it will come up . 
neutral, Alright . Then maybe we can do the floor first . These wood floors under this carpet are beautiful . And me too — — I can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here . But how can we get it out ? Do we have to hire someone ? 
neutral," Of course , could you help to blow up some balloons ? "
neutral," Yes , I'm sure I've done a lot of house painting in my life . And my mother was very picky . If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . So I learned to be very careful . "
neutral, I hate balloons . 
neutral, Are you sure ? 
neutral," Surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little English . "
neutral,My husband goes out drinking with his friends every night . I'm fed up with it . 
neutral,Here is your bill . It's $ 60 . 
neutral, Maybe you two should go see a marriage counselor . 
neutral, Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone . 
neutral," For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study . "
neutral, That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones . 
neutral,Hey John . I have some great news . 
neutral," No , thank you . Check , please . "
neutral,"Bill , do you know when did the Chinese begin to celebrate Teachers ' Day ? "
neutral,I think we should do the floors before we work on the curtains and walls . 
neutral,I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime ! 
neutral, God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ? 
neutral, It ’ s true . Guess what we were talking about last night . 
neutral," Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day . "
neutral, She never cares about others . 
neutral, Wait a moment . I will calculate it for you . Your bill comes to $ 36 . 
neutral, They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest . 
neutral," It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points . "
neutral, I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project . 
neutral, Who was it ? 
neutral,I was just about to go to bed when the telephone rang last night . 
neutral, Channel 8 . 
neutral, You're welcome . 
neutral, I ’ ll just have to wait for UCLA . 
neutral,"Well , no one could survive without water , but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking . "
neutral, Yeah . Water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues . 
neutral, But what are the sources of water pollution ? 
neutral, They could generally be divided into two categories 
neutral, I ’ m sorry that you didn ’ t get in . 
neutral," Well , direct ones are the pollution directly from factories , refineries waste treatment plants etc . , aren ’ t they ? "
neutral, Thank you . Is that a window table ? 
neutral, Yeah . They are emitted directly into urban water supplies . 
neutral, But what about the indirect ones ? 
neutral, It doesn't seem quite interesting . Would you change the channel ? 
neutral, I don't know why I cannot take a step forward . 
neutral,Do you want some dessert ? 
neutral," She is eight . Actually , I'm buying a good set of art supplies for her as a birthday gift . "
neutral,How do you feel about teaching my friend how to read ? 
neutral, What's this amount for ? 
neutral, How old is your friend and why doesn't he know how to read ? 
neutral, He's 78 and he's a new emigrant from South America and he's never been to school . 
neutral, Does he even know how to speak English ? 
neutral, It's for the drinks . 
neutral, No . But I thought that you could start with reading and then go from there . 
neutral, That was very thoughtful of you to volunteer me . 
neutral, I see . Can I pay by credit card ? 
neutral, Sure . 
neutral, It ’ s a letter from UCLA about my acceptance . 
neutral, Who ’ s the letter from ? 
neutral, Come on . You're great at teaching and I know you will love him . He's adorable ! 
neutral, Let me see it . 
neutral, It's a wise thing to do . Art will do a child a world of good . 
neutral,Here ’ s a letter for you . 
neutral, It ’ s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves 
neutral," Yes , he used to be . But now he ’ s drifting off track . "
neutral," Well , that's fine . Bring us a bottle of that . "
neutral,How annoying ! 
neutral, What's the matter ? 
neutral," He must have been in bad company , or he wouldn ’ t be off the beans . "
neutral," Yes , I went there five years ago . You were still a baby at that time . "
neutral," Every time I try to start this program , the computer freezes . "
neutral, Maybe there's something wrong with the program . 
neutral,"Professor Li , do you know where to buy art supplies ? "
neutral,"Hello , madam , I am sorry for keeping you waiting so long . Now please follow me and I will show you your table . "
neutral, For what ? Are you taking up painting ? 
neutral," Oh , good . How old is your niece ? "
neutral,"As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives . "
neutral, I'm looking forward to it . 
neutral," Yes , I saw one . Believe me . "
neutral," You are meeting trouble halfway , I guess . "
neutral, Many things are troubling me . I don't know whether I should come and go . 
neutral, I am cooking now ! 
neutral, Have you ever heard of a movie rental company called Netflix ? They send the movies directly to your house in the mail . 
neutral, I feel eggplants are more nutritious . 
neutral,I prefer potatoes to eggplants . 
neutral, I agree . And it's very convenient . 
neutral,"You're right . Watching movies at home is way cheaper than going to the theater , too . I like downloading movies too because it's easy and fast . "
neutral, I still like the olive one best . There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you . 
neutral," The question is , can he have it done before Friday ? "
neutral, My mum and my sister do the housework and cooking but I clean my room . 
neutral, Do you help with the housework ? 
neutral," Oh , you're welcome . "
neutral,Do you know where Helen is ? 
neutral, She's gone to a flower shop . Today is her husband's birthday . 
neutral, That reminds me . My wedding anniversary is tomorrow . 
neutral,Did you hear about Neil ? 
neutral, Don't you think it's about time you got them working properly ? 
neutral, Oh . I see . Don't you have Mao Tai ? 
neutral," No , what ? "
neutral,"I have a complaint to make . The bill you sent me was incorrect . What's more , it isn't the first time "
neutral," Sorry , sir , but I recommend you Bacardi White . It's quite delitous . "
neutral, I hope so . But I'm always caught short . 
neutral,I think it's important that all people have the ability to read . 
neutral, Just trim vegetables for cooking . I will cut up the meat . 
neutral, Of course . What do you want me to do ? 
neutral, You're kidding ! 
neutral," Look , most of the maple leaves have turned red . "
neutral, I'm afraid not ! Now this is just between you and me . 
neutral, Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene ? 
neutral,What sports do you think women excel at most ? 
neutral, Are you good at cooking ? 
neutral," I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking ! "
neutral, I can't remember . 
neutral, I agree entirely . I assure you it won't happen again . 
neutral," I talked to her for a while , but she ’ s really depressed . So , I made an appointment with the school counselor for her . "
neutral, What did you do ? 
neutral,"Good morning , Miss Wang . How beautiful you look today ! "
neutral, But it's only a film . 
neutral, Thank you . I'm wearing make-up . 
neutral, I hate the hero.He ' s too cruel . 
neutral, Who taught you to put on make-up ? 
neutral, It's me . I have studied make-up at a beauty shop . 
neutral, Can you teach me how to do make-up ? 
neutral," Of course . First , use eye shadow to heighten your eyes . "
neutral, My dog has spots . He is very strong . 
neutral, What eye shadow do you think is the most fit for me ? 
neutral, But I don ’ t like big strong dogs . 
neutral,May I take your order ? 
neutral," I think women excel in every sport except the ones that are taboo for us to join in , like football . "
neutral, I think pink eye shadow is popular among Chinese girls . 
neutral," Yeah , she ’ s broken up about it , poor kid . "
neutral," Oh , that ’ s very sad . "
neutral, Her father is dying . 
neutral, Why ? 
neutral, How do you protect yourself from chapped lips ? 
neutral,One of my students told me she was very depressed today . 
neutral," I suggest you use lipstick , which also accentuates your lips . "
neutral,I don't know what I can do now . I'm down and out . 
neutral, What's the specialty of the house ? 
neutral, How did you grow such long nails ? 
neutral, You have to pay attention to trimming them from time to time . 
neutral, The baked fish in tomato sauce is pretty good . 
neutral," But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better . "
neutral,What's the name of the singer who sings this song ? 
neutral," Yes , it's to my liking , too . "
neutral, I mean which ones are they better at than men ? 
neutral, You only need to tell me that once . 
neutral," Of course , my father used to take me to Kiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child . "
neutral, And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? 
neutral," Was I ? Sorry , I didn ’ t mean to be . I do apologize . "
neutral, No way . I've given you too many chances already . 
neutral, Really ? It's a deal . Have you ever been there ? 
neutral, I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . 
neutral, Does it make a lot of noise ? 
neutral, Yeah . Anyway he is driving me mad . 
neutral,How was your trip to Brazil ? Did you learn anything ? 
neutral, I had no idea how seriously that country takes soccer ! 
neutral, Tell me about it . 
neutral, Thank you . Please bring me some paper napkins . 
neutral,My son has really taken it out of me . He never keeps out of mischief . 
neutral, Here you are . 
neutral, Really ? 
neutral, OK . I'll change the time to 8: 00 . 
neutral," Oh , but why ? "
neutral, One of my neighbors has a dog . 
neutral, What's wrong ? 
neutral," I thought it was in a quiet neighborhood , but it isn't . "
neutral,How's your new apartment ? 
neutral,"Do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ? "
neutral, Thank you . 
neutral," Usually , the restaurant will be quieter at that time . "
neutral," Yes , it is annoying . "
neutral, Let me see . It seems a little late . 
neutral," Just a minute . I'll check if there is any availability . I'm sorry , sir . There isn't any table left for 7:00 , but we can give you one at 8: 00 . Would you like to make a reservation at that time ? "
neutral, Yes . I'd like a table for six at 7:00 this evening . Can you arrange it for us ? 
neutral, I think I should be more careful next time . 
neutral,I'm afraid of the darkness . 
neutral,"Hello , Steven , what are you doing now ? "
neutral, Are you serious ? 
neutral, Yes . May I help you ? 
neutral, Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . 
neutral,"Waiter , get me rag , please . I have just spilled my wine . "
neutral,"When shooting a gun , accuracy is very important . "
neutral," I'll take one , too . "
neutral, Why do you care ? Women and men are different all around . I don't think they can be compared . 
neutral, That's a good point . Let me change my question . What sports do women like best ? 
neutral, I like fish . Please bring me an order of that . 
neutral, Do you want some dessert ? 
neutral,I like the design of the coat . 
neutral," Well , I know some women who love golf and I know others who love contact sports . "
neutral," Apple pie , please . "
neutral, Are you saying that women can't be generally categorized ? 
neutral, Are you suggesting that anyone can be ? 
neutral," No hard feelings . After all , he is a child . "
neutral,"Hey , Peter , have you had lunch yet ? "
neutral, I really want to take him over my knee . 
neutral, Let me help you . 
neutral, Single or double ? 
neutral, On Saturday we all go to the park and the dog comes with us . 
neutral, Who takes the dog on Saturday ? 
neutral," And I take the dog for a walk every Wednesday , Thursday and Friday . "
neutral," No . My father takes the dog for a walk every Monday , Tuesday and Sunday . "
neutral, Make it two . 
neutral," I'm sorry , but I've got an important job to do . "
neutral, Do you take your dog for a walk every day ? 
neutral, We also have a cat and a dog . 
neutral,"You're going to abandon me , just like that ? "
neutral," Yes , I live in that house with my parents and my sister . "
neutral, No need ! I know how to make dumplings . Let's do it from scratch . Can you give me a hand in the kitchen ? I don't think I can finish everything by myself . 
neutral, It barks all night long . 
neutral,Do you live in the red house at the end of the road ? 
neutral, It's John . 
neutral, No . How about you ?

neutral, Coco Lee . 
neutral,Where's your better half ? 
neutral, She's at home . 
neutral,We'd better leave now . 
neutral, I beg your pardon ? 
neutral,I just got sacked . 
neutral, You are sort of romantic . 
neutral," I always like to see the oldies , like The Sound of Music , Gone with the Wind . They are realty the best - in the acting , the scene and the plot . "
neutral, Thanks . 
neutral,"I'm sorry , but I can't come to your party . "
neutral, What a shame ! 
neutral,Have a nice weekend . 
neutral, Same to you . 
neutral,What do you do ? 
neutral, Thank you . 
neutral,Can you imagine a boat letting in the river ? 
neutral,What a coincidence seeing you here . ! 
neutral, Don ’ t make a mountain out of molehill . I am sure he will do that on his payday . 
neutral, Jack borrowed a large sum of money from me and didn ’ t pay me back . 
neutral," It is , isn't it ? "
neutral, I don't like feature films . I think sometimes it loses contact with reality . I like to see some documentary films . What kind of feature films do you like best ? 
neutral, It's cool . 
neutral, Why ? 
neutral, I like feature films best . How about you ? 
neutral, I like it . It's a beautiful country . 
neutral,What kind of films do you like best ? 
neutral,Hello ? 
neutral," Oh , how were you saved finally ? "
neutral, You too . 
neutral,Bye . Take care . 
neutral," Then I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , isn't it ? "
neutral," You can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it . "
neutral," I have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened . "
neutral,What is wrong with your face ? 
neutral, You said it . Many parents just don ’ t understand know how to educate their children . 
neutral, Don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all . 
neutral," In order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software . "
neutral, Can you recommend some to me ? 
neutral, Certainly . Realplayer is a good . 
neutral, Can I download it ? 
neutral," Yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it . "
neutral, I'll try it tonight . 
neutral,"Do you have any particular hobbies , Tom ? "
neutral," Oh , yes . I love playing badminton , table tennis and computer games . And playing the games has become my favorite . "
neutral,I am so bored all day . 
neutral, I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers . And they don't care about their own health at all . How about you ? 
neutral, What are you talking about ? 
neutral," You won't play online games full of violence , will you ? "
neutral,It ’ s really terrible ! 
neutral, Once in a while . 
neutral," Shut up . You should think how to make fortunes , not look for a squabble . "
neutral, Maybe you should ask her what she wants for her birthday . 
neutral,Our house is too small . We had better have a big one . 
neutral, It's no good . And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time . You might as well do something healthy and meaningful . 
neutral, I was in such a panic at that time . Fortunately another boat came along and I was saved from drowning . 
neutral," Sorry , I think you have the wrong number . "
neutral," Hi , is Heather there please ? "
neutral, Thanks a lot . 
neutral,Do you have a minute ? 
neutral, Sure . What's up ? 
neutral," I'm no better than them . They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time , but I think it's stimulating . "
neutral, I ’ m at the end of tether . I run out of ideas . 
neutral, The best island of Korea-Jizhou island . 
neutral, But that should not be the reason for you to lose heart . 
neutral,Do you like singing ? 
neutral,You sure are buying a lot of things online . 
neutral," Yes , I do . "
neutral, Let's go to a ETV tonight . 
neutral, But I can't sing it well . 
neutral,"Hello , do you have any vacancies ? "
neutral," OK , I'Il go with you . When shall we go ? "
neutral, What about six ? 
neutral," To my mind , the success of Digest is in the clever selection of its articles in each issue . "
neutral," Yes , I ordered a camera and some personal care stuff online yesterday . They will be delivered in two weeks . "
neutral, OK . Let's make it . 
neutral," But I think Digest is supposed to be the top one . Its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . It's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it . "
neutral, Great ! 
neutral,You can't beat me at tennis . 
neutral,My hair stood on end when I saw the bloody scene . 
neutral, How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed . 
neutral,Excuse me . May I come in ? 
neutral, Sure . Come on in . 
neutral,Do you have the time ? 
neutral, It's ten thirty . 
neutral,"Hi , nice to hear from you , when does your plane leave ? "
neutral, It leaves in 20 minutes . 
neutral, What are the advantages of buying online ? 
neutral, Good . 
neutral, Can you pick me up from the airport ? 
neutral, He is hopeless . 
neutral," As a teacher , I don ’ t know how to help him . "
neutral, You have hit the point . It's really hard for a magazine to be well known to people of various ages and educational backgrounds . 
neutral, The boy is good for nothing . 
neutral,There are thousands of magazines published in the world to meet the needs of different readers . But only a few of them are influential world-wide . 
neutral, Do you want to bet ? 
neutral, Why not listen to music online ? 
neutral, Are you deaf or what ? 
neutral, You can't be serious . 
neutral," It's a one-bedroom , one-bathroom apartment . "
neutral, Yeah . He really does let me down . 
neutral," Attractive scenery , pleasant climate , these make it charming . "
neutral,Is the table free ? 
neutral," Yes , I think so . But there is also something terrible . "
neutral, What do you mean ? 
neutral, Sometimes the traffic is too busy . 
neutral, What kind of apartment is it ? 
neutral," Yes , something just opened up . "
neutral, Why not ? 
neutral,That ’ s really a let-down . 
neutral,I've heard so much about Japan . Is it a beautiful country ? 
neutral," Not everyone thinks Japan is beautiful , but to me its beauty is breathtaking.You feel the same way about France , don't you ? "
neutral," Yes , I do feel the same way about France . The swift rivers , the fertile valleys , the large cities-its scenery is beautiful . Will you describe the geography of Japan ? "
neutral,What did you say ? 
neutral," Well , it's made up of four large islands and many smaller islands located off the coast of the Asian main lands . France isn't an island , is it ? "
neutral, Not often . Just when I make mistakes . 
neutral, You mean that he is bad-tempered and often gets angry with you . 
neutral," Good harbors ! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world , and Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world . Also , there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands . France isn't very mountainous , is it ? "
neutral," No , France isn't very mountainous . But it does contain the Pyrenees , a large mountain range with high peaks and deep canyons . What kind of Climate does Japan have ? "
neutral," No , sir . Would you rather sit near the dance floor ? "
neutral,My father ’ s angry face always makes my blood run cold . 
neutral, OK . That's what I can do . 
neutral," The Japanese climate is warm and moist in the south , mild in the central part and cold in the north . Except for Hokkaido , we don't get much snowfall at all . France has a mild climate , doesn't it ? "
neutral," Yes , the climate of France rarely has severe winters . In southern France , one can live in comfort the whole year . Is Japan good for farming ? "
neutral," Yes , Japan is good for farming . Rice is the main crop , but Japan is also an industrial center . Fishing is very important , too . Rice isn't grown in France , is it ? "
neutral," No , rice isn't grown in France . But farming , fishing and industry are also very important in France . I'd like to go to Japan some day . Would you like to visit France ? "
neutral," Yes . I'd like to visit France . I'd like to travel all over the world . As you describe it , France seems to be very much like Japan . I would like to see it for myself . "
neutral, What scene ? 
neutral,I quit my job . 
neutral," Oh , no , France isn't an island . It is located in the western part of the European continent . But France does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts . Does Japan have good harbors ? "
neutral,It seems that nobody in your class likes Paul .

neutral, I'm going to buy a CD . 
neutral," Oh , it is conveniently located , isn't it ? "

neutral, Take it easy . We are going to have our own baby . You should be happy . 
neutral, That's why I think it may suit my needs . 
neutral, I am sorry for that . We will improve the dishes next time . 
neutral,Is there anything I can do for you ? 
neutral, I believe it will . It comes furnished . You can move in immediately after the lease is signed . 
neutral,"Jenny , do you want to go to see a movie ? "
neutral, About what ? 
neutral, What's on tonight ? 
neutral, I want to see ' Click . ' 
neutral, Who is in this movie ? 
neutral, But this is terrible . I'm expecting important calls . 
neutral, I don't know . My friend told me it was a touching movie . 
neutral,How's John doing ? 
neutral, He can barely make ends meet . 
neutral,Why are you shivering ? 
neutral, So I couldn't get through . I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start.It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . That's why I'm late . 
neutral, It's freezing . 
neutral," Really ? I had no idea . Let me check.Yes , it's dead . There's no dial tone . "

neutral," Take your time . When you need anything , just call me . "
neutral, Where did you learn it ? 
neutral, Will it possible for me to rent the apartment on a month-by-month basis ? 
neutral, Yes . But not including the utilities .

neutral, Heather Johnson . 
neutral, Yes . Who are you looking for again ? 
neutral, What an attractive place ! How can I get there ? 
neutral, You can take No . 2 bus . 
neutral,Why do you look so sad ? 
neutral,How did you do that ? 
neutral, It was a piece of cake . 
neutral,Do you have change for a hundred ? 
neutral, Sure . 
neutral,"See you later , alligator . "

neutral, I had a great time . It ’ ll be good to see them again . 
neutral, Is this 617-228-2289 ? 
neutral, That's great . 
neutral, I laughed up my sleeves at him . He ’ s seen his girlfriend off at the airport and had lipstick on his face and did not know it . 
neutral,Where are you going ? 
neutral, Wish him to be healthy soon . 
neutral, Why ? 
neutral,Can you recommend a resort to me ? 
neutral,Sorry . I've got to run . 
neutral,I ’ m itching for moving !

neutral,"Mary , it was wrong of you to be so late . Mother ’ s very worried . "
neutral, OK . See you . 
neutral," Oh , you know , tomorrow is Vicky's birthday . I am thinking what gift to give her . "
neutral, It's a bad idea . Vicky has short hair . 
neutral," Well , what about a brooch ? "
neutral, Really ? 
neutral," Yes , let's go in . "
neutral," It is a new park , isn't it ? "
neutral, Only old women like that . 
neutral," Yes , how do you know ? "
neutral, I guessed it . 
neutral, She went to the store to buy some groceries . Would you like to leave a message ? 
neutral, Why not go and see a doctor ? 
neutral," Oh , how wonderful ! "
neutral, I ’ m in pretty bad shape . I am having an allergy all the time . 
neutral,Did you have a good holiday ? 
neutral, Yes and no . 
neutral, That's easy . A girl at her age must like beautiful ornaments . How about a hair pin ? 
neutral, All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up . 
neutral," Okay , I'll pick you up at eight o'clock . "
neutral,I'm going to America . 
neutral, Don't shoot . I give up . 
neutral,Do you have a light ? 
neutral,Joan is a thorough drag ! 
neutral, What color ? 
neutral, The mayor and high official practice crony is mand a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions . 
neutral," Sorry , I don't smoke . "
neutral,Excuse me . Nature calls . 
neutral," Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds . "
neutral,The performance is amazing . I'm curious about how they did it . I mean the way they sing . 
neutral, But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past . 
neutral, So cool . Someone gave me this flier at the exit . What's it about ? 
neutral," Let me have a look . Well , it lists some shows that will be on next week . "
neutral," Oh , tell me about it . Anything interesting ? "
neutral," Hmm ... Oh , this one , ' The Drunken Beauty ' . This is a real classic . "
neutral," ' The Drunken Beauty ' ? It's funny that we have ' Sleeping Beauty ' in my country . Anyway , what's it about ? Is the beauty a drunkard ? "
neutral, Of course not . She was said to be the most beautiful woman in her time and that made her become the queen . They play was famous for its singing and dancing . 
neutral, What's the cause ? 
neutral, It is Train No . 249 . It will depart in four hours . 
neutral,This small town has many serious problems . 
neutral," Sure , people do that when they are drunk . What about the actress ? "
neutral, She is an opera star in China . Her teacher's teacher is Mei Landfang . 
neutral," What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them . "
neutral," Partly , and he's also a hardworking man . "
neutral, Just because he gets on well with everybody ? 
neutral, Yes . I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted . 
neutral, You are such an expert on it . I don't know that . 
neutral,Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive . 
neutral, Are you sure ? 
neutral," There are a lot of ways to help a kid build up self-esteem , but to begin with , you can try and give him more rewards . Rewards will help a chil improve his self-esteem . "
neutral,Freeze ! 
neutral, Don't ask me . 
neutral,What's a good place for sightseeing ? 
neutral, What is it ? 
neutral," No , I encourage her to go her own way , but she's now having a change of heart . "
neutral, Did she give up her decision to marry Dick ? 
neutral, Sarah and I could see eye to eye with each other . 
neutral," Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits . "
neutral, You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too . 
neutral, Sure . What about you ? What do you like about the Olympics ? 
neutral,"Good morning , Mrs . Smith . "
neutral," I'm not sure . I know I should know that , but I can't remember right now . "
neutral, I can predict it will have the largest circulation in one or two years . 
neutral," Come on , Nancy . Play it cool . I go with you and burn the middle night oil tonight . "
neutral, Which train is the ticket for ? 
neutral, I always am . You just didn't notice . 
neutral,"Belinda , I ’ m going to a party tonight . What shall I wear ? "
neutral, Is it formal or informal ? 
neutral, How can his he do that ? 
neutral, I guess it ’ s formal . 
neutral," Then , you should dress well . "
neutral, I think perhaps the news stories in it are truthful and accurate . It also has a special page about the stock market ; maybe this is the real reason for its popularity . Many people are now speculating in the stock market . 
neutral, What's the reason that people prefer to read this one ? 
neutral, You are smart . 
neutral," Of course , the sports shoes don ’ t go with the formal occasions . "
neutral," Well , they're for your wife , so I think you should give her roses . "
neutral,Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . 
neutral," I'd recommend you the Morning Paper , it is true that the paper is a newly issued one , but its circulation is rising . Last month , it reached to three hundred thousand , which is a very good figure for a new paper . "
neutral, Roses will be fine . 
neutral, She keeps talking when I'm reading . 
neutral,There are many new kinds of newspapers . I find it hard to choose among them . Which is the most popular paper circulating in our city ? 
neutral," Good idea . Oh , by the way , would you please pick me up after the party , honey ? "
neutral, It ’ ll be too late ; you ’ d better take a taxi . 
neutral, OK . 
neutral, You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us . 
neutral, This may be complicated . But I think he may need to build up his self-esteem . 
neutral, That will be great . 
neutral,You are saying he will be promoted to the general manager ? 
neutral, What a pity ! 
neutral, Why did you say that ? It's a good thing for him to live with his son . 
neutral, To think of it ! All my old silver ! It meant so much to me . 
neutral, What fools we were ! 
neutral,"Here , Let me get the door for you . "
neutral, Just let it be . Her rudeness will come back to haunt her . 
neutral, In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ? 
neutral, Me too . But anyway we hope he lives happily in the future . 
neutral,There is a wonderful opera today . I'd like to see it . 
neutral, I do not like the play with complicated plot . What's on today ? 
neutral," ' The sound of music ' . This music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages . It is about a happy family without sex , violence or bad language . "
neutral," Well , they ' re not here.They are in the dustbin . "
neutral, I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did . She was a great cook . She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night . 
neutral, We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience . 
neutral, He is going to Canada and to live with his son . 
neutral, You Americans usually have nutritious food . 
neutral, Those young actors play the roles perfectly . 
neutral, What are you looking for now ? 
neutral," Sorry , love . "
neutral, It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes . 
neutral, Oh ... 
neutral, What's wrong with it ? It's filthy ! 
neutral, What's wrong with it ? 
neutral, I use a special dressing and homemade catsup . 
neutral,Mike ! Look at the floor ! 
neutral, It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue . 
neutral, Let's go . We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant . 
neutral,What happened to that girl you were seeing ? 
neutral," Can you deliver them , please ? "
neutral, What's the address ? 
neutral, My cigarettes . 
neutral, Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo . 
neutral,How would you like your hair cut ? 
neutral," Yeah , he is going to move next month . "
neutral, I don ’ t know what he wants to do . Does he want help me or just scold me ? 
neutral, Why do you say that ? 
neutral,What are you doing ? 
neutral, I'm surfing the Net . 
neutral,We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts . 
neutral,I am confused by what he said . 
neutral, What's his problem ? 
neutral, Maybe . But it still gets on my nerves . 
neutral," It is not too late . Pass your ticket to me , please . "
neutral, I saw her dating with her ex-boyfriend again . 
neutral," He is doing OK , but he pretends he is doing much better by telling lies . "
neutral, Why not ? I'd love to do that . 
neutral, Is he doing very well at school ? 
neutral, Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ? 
neutral, Where is he going ? 
neutral, Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ? 
neutral, I surely do . They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that . 
neutral, It's my girlfriend . I guess she's playing the army game . 
neutral, I want it short . 
neutral, Unbelievable ! I could never do that . 
neutral, And his story didn't even hold together . I feel such an idiot . 
neutral, I think red would be nice . 
neutral, Don't worry about it . 
neutral, Do you need a hand with that ? 
neutral," Yes , let's do it . "
neutral, Follow me . Make sure not to interrupt them . 
neutral, Of course not . We don't do that . 
neutral, Do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them ? 
neutral," What's so terrible too , is the fools we've made of ourselves . "
neutral, What ? Are you sure about that ? 
neutral," Then , I'll just trim it . "
neutral," Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it . "
neutral," I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ? "
neutral," When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports . "
neutral, Who started the modern Olympics ? 
neutral, They're for my Wife . Her name is Samantha . 
neutral, What kind of flowers would you like ? 
neutral, This question is a piece of cake . A Frenchman named Baron de Coubertin . 
neutral, What did people call him ? 
neutral, Of course he was called ' the father of the Olympics ' . 
neutral, What did he do for restoring the Olympics ? 
neutral, It's a kitty . 
neutral," OK , I promise . What is it ? "
neutral, I've told you I'm an expert . 
neutral," I'm looking for it , but you see , the market is hard up for jobs , too . "
neutral,"Hi ! Bob , are you having problems with that ? "
neutral, What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see . 
neutral, Nothing . 
neutral, Who are they for ? 
neutral," Great , thanks a lot . "
neutral,What's today's date ? 
neutral, You can say that again . 
neutral, It's January . 
neutral,I'm really mad at Bob . 
neutral, What for ? ( Why ? ) 
neutral,What's the matter ? 
neutral, I don't know . I don't know too much about flowers . Can you recommend something ? 
neutral, I'm feeling a little under the weather . 
neutral,What would you like to drink ? 
neutral,My granny is such a kind-hearted person . She is willing to help . 
neutral, I'll just have water . 
neutral,Would you like some more rice ? 
neutral," No , thanks . I'm full . "
neutral,I'm going shopping . 
neutral,"Sam , we are hard up for the everyday expenses . When can you find a job . "
neutral, Do you have enough money to buy that dress ? 
neutral," Hi , I'd like to order some flowers . "
neutral, Good . Why do people name it Olympics ? 
neutral, Any idea when you'll leave ? 
neutral, I hope before the end of the month . 
neutral, Let me know when you find out . 
neutral,Is this seat taken ? 
neutral, No . Have a seat . 
neutral, Maybe I'll have to face the music . 
neutral," Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame . "
neutral, We had a fantastic time . 
neutral, Did you go to the Magic Kingdom ? 
neutral," No , but we went to the Kennedy Center . "
neutral, It's no use arguing the toss . 
neutral,I'm worried sick that she will leave me tomorrow . 
neutral,Where's your hometown ? 
neutral, I don't think so . Is that table all right ? 
neutral, They name it after the place where it was first held . 
neutral, He's a sad dog . He came to the wedding in jeans ! 
neutral, I ’ m sorry . But I don ’ t meant to get your goat . 
neutral, You always have a chip on your shoulder . 
neutral, Shandong . 
neutral,I see that there are Olympic mascots in your car . 
neutral, That's free . 
neutral," Yes . I am very interested in the Olympic Games , and I'm especially excited about 2008 Beijing Olympics . "
neutral," Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble . "
neutral, The idea of doing it at night is interesting . Maybe I'll try it some day . 
neutral,I have a bone to pick with you . 
neutral, That's cool . Care for a little quiz on that ? 
neutral,"Good afternoon , how may I help you ? "
neutral, No problem . I'm an ' Olympic expert ' . 
neutral," Wow , you've talked the talk . Now it's time to walk the walk . Here we go . First , can you tell me something about the ancient Olympics ? "
neutral, The ancient Olympics originated in ancient Greece . 
neutral," Sometimes you can save money and you can find things that you had difficulty finding in a store . sometimes it's just convenient , like doing it late at night and sometimes it's just fun . "
neutral, Indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater . 
neutral, No . I need to borrow $ 50 . 
neutral," Sure , here you go . "
neutral, My pleasure . ( It was my pleasure . ) 
neutral,Why are you laughing ? 
neutral, I can't help it . 
neutral,I'll be seeing you around . 
neutral, OK.Take care . 
neutral,There will be a party in my company ; what shall I wear ? 
neutral, Is it formal or informal ? 
neutral, Today's her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers . 
neutral," I guess it is a formal one because the general director will give a speech there , and most of the staff will take part in . "
neutral," In that case , formal suit with a nice tie will be better . "
neutral, You are right . What about shoes ? 
neutral, She ’ s your sister.What she asked was only duck soup for you.Why can ’ t you be good to her ? 
neutral, What kind of books does she like ? 
neutral," Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother . "
neutral,Look ! The girl is so beautiful and she is smiling at me . She is lovely . 
neutral, Don ’ t mention it . 
neutral,I broke my sister's mirror . I'm sure it'll get her back up . I really don't know how I can escape the punishment . 
neutral, I ’ m just coming for that . 
neutral, You'd better tell your sister what happened and face the music . 
neutral,Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ? 
neutral," Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ? "
neutral, Can you take he away from me ? 
neutral,"Tom , is Jenny crying ? "
neutral, But Joe won't you . 
neutral," If I were him , I wouldn'tbrazen it outby asking my parents for money . "
neutral, He has no sense . 
neutral,Didn't Joe feel it a shame to live on his parents since he has graduated from college ? 
neutral, Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . 
neutral," That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems . "
neutral, Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ? 
neutral, Do you know what kind of flowers she likes ? 
neutral, OK . What's the reason you are sending her flowers ? 
neutral, She's very fond of detective stories . 
neutral," I can't agree with you . She's pretty , but she always blows hot and cold . "
neutral,Where are you from ? 
neutral, I'm from Canada . 
neutral,Can you imagine having a million dollars ? 
neutral," Yes , and I know a few things I'd spend the money on . "

neutral," Oh , you want my chocolate cakes , so to speak ! "
neutral, A new car for a start . 
neutral,When's your birthday ? 
neutral,"Quite a few times , I had my back to the wall . "
neutral, It seemed to be useless to study well when we were young if we examine his case . 
neutral,Excuse me . Can I get a refund of my ticket ? I have to cancel my trip because I have something emergent to deal with . 
neutral, It's just around the corner . 
neutral,Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ? 
neutral,Do you mind if I ask your friend out ? 
neutral," Okay , that's good . "
neutral," When we were students , he was no good in any subject . "
neutral, Do you want me to put in a good word for you ? 
neutral,What brings you to Beijing ? 
neutral," He does , he started five years ago and now ends up the richest among us . "
neutral,"He has a long head , I bet he will do well in his business . "
neutral, I'm here on business . 
neutral, Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ? 
neutral," I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator . "
neutral," She's my sister , you know . "
neutral," Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk . "
neutral," Yes , please do that . "
neutral, What makes you think so ? 
neutral,It's awfully hot . 
neutral," Of course , but we aren't going out , we're just friends . "
neutral, It's very nice of you . 
neutral," Yeah , how do you know about that ? "
neutral," I see . For the sake of us all , we should be an active participator in the prevention of it . "
neutral, Where is the school cafeteria ? 
neutral," It's such a hot season , isn't it ? May I suggest thinning out the top ? "
neutral, Where to ? 
neutral," Please cut the sides shorter , but not so much at the back . "
neutral," It is in that brand new , tall building over there . On the 9th floor . "
neutral,"Excuse me , i am a new student here . Could you tell me where the English Department is ? "
neutral, that's right . Most of the Chinese students pursuing higher education in Australia intend to return to China . 
neutral, Very well . Please sit down here . Do you want me to cut your hair very close ? 
neutral, Yes . What time does it start and do you want to meet me there ? 
neutral, Good morning . I'd like to have a haircut . 
neutral, the rapidly expanding economy has encouraged many students to pack their bags AMD head for home . 
neutral, Great ! I have a coupon for free popcorn at that theater ! 
neutral,"Hi , I'm Jake . I'm new to the choir . What's your name ? "
neutral," Hello , there , my name is Tonia . "
neutral, It is the basement of that red building in front of the tower with big bells . 
neutral, Do you sing alto ? 
neutral, Thank you . 
neutral," This way please . First , we should clean your face with our clarifying cream . And then we use the massage cream . Next do the massage . I hope that you can feel comfortable . "
neutral, Thank you . I've got just 50 minutes to go . Can we manage ? 
neutral,Hello . In order to kill your time you can experience our facial massage for free . 
neutral, It's good to have you in the group . We can always use a good baritone ! 
neutral," absolutely , many Chinese enterprises are going global , and they are in great need of excellent returnees to help them with their overseas business . "
neutral, That's disappointing . I was really looking forward to it . 
neutral,The weather has been terrible this week . 
neutral," yeah , China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country . "
neutral," Yeah , I'm worried . If it's like this tomorrow , our big outdoor party will have to be canceled . "
neutral," well , I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment . "
neutral, Let's hope it clears up . 
neutral, Alright . 
neutral, Hey let's go out tomorrow night . The Ram Bar and Grill is having a special on pitchers . 
neutral,"Good morning . What can I do for you , sir ? "
neutral, why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad . 
neutral, They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere . 
neutral, The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library . 
neutral, It doesn't matter . We can go to the ferris wheel later . 
neutral," Oh , you don't ask much , do you ? "
neutral, I promise I will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition . 
neutral, I'll tell you what . Your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones . 
neutral, That sounds fair . That's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us . 
neutral, Not as fun though . A live band is way more exciting ! 
neutral, Our class doesn't have enough money . We already checked into it . 
neutral, Let me know with your next dance . I know a band that may give you a break for the publicity . 
neutral, ( several minutes later ) Now it's done . Is it satisfactory ? 
neutral," OK , let's go . "
neutral, You bet . I'm really excited . 
neutral,Let's do something really nice for our family this Christmas . 
neutral, What did you have in mind ? 
neutral, What can you see from a tram or a double-decker ? 
neutral, Where is the Computer Center ? 
neutral, We haven't come here in business but for pleasure . We should go out exciting . What can you see in the subway ? Nothing ! 
neutral, I just know I want to get out of the mindless gift trap . 
neutral, What's the difference ? 
neutral," This isn't network , Frida . We are in San Francisco . "
neutral,"Hello , I want to order an Easy-own package . What would you recommend ? "
neutral, I know what you mean . 
neutral, I want to give a gift that is really meaningful . 
neutral, Or do something that shows we have spent time thinking about them . 
neutral," Which function do you use more , making calls or sending short messages ? "
neutral, Or what only we are able to give them . 
neutral, Where is the library ? 
neutral,There's a double feature at the cinema this Saturday . Do you want to go with me ? 
neutral, It's convenient . People in network go everywhere by subway if they don't drive . 
neutral, What are the movies that are playing ? 
neutral,just don't understand why we have to take the subway . Look at this place . It's modern enough . But it's far from lively . 
neutral, I don't know yet . 
neutral,Can I borrow your Cds for our school dance ? 
neutral, Thank you . 
neutral, I can't afford to miss my 9:40 flight . 
neutral," yeah , you should first decide what kind of career you really want , plan your career path , and then try your best to achieve your goal . "
neutral, You're lucky . 
neutral, What do you do to deal with the stress ? 
neutral, I don't know . Do you have any advice for me ? 
neutral," I like beer , it's just that I get a headache when I drink more than 3 . "
neutral," If you don't like beer , have you tried mixed drinks ? Some of them are pretty good . "
neutral, That's true . 
neutral, wait ! You can't do so many things at the same time . What exactly do you want ? 
neutral," I want to become a professor , a lawyer , an editor , a civil servant ... "
neutral, what kind of job do you want after graduation ? 
neutral, career path ? I'm not sure . 
neutral," Yes , of course . I live near the university . Hop in please . "
neutral, Do you have a clear career path to follow ? 
neutral," I'm planning to go to graduate school , but I also want to find a job . Otherwise , I'll have nowhere to go if I fail the entrance exam . "
neutral," Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school , they never expected much . "
neutral," No . We usually go to places that have specials . Dante's over on the Ave has $ 5.00 pitchers on Mondays . So for ten , fifteen bucks , I can get a lot of drinks . "
neutral,You'll soon graduate from your university . Do you have any plans for the future ? 
neutral," I think you lack in the power of decision . Once you make your decision , don't be overtaken by misgivings and fear . Just go full steam ahead ! "
neutral, Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds ! 
neutral," I had one , but I didn't like the job very much . I wanted to attend graduate school , but I was afraid it would be too tough . "
neutral," Not , if you don ’ t want to . "
neutral," while seeing others going to work or continue their study , I didn't know what I would do . "
neutral, What other activities will you have tomorrow ? 
neutral," Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward , we will make New Year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second . "
neutral, how could it be ? 
neutral, Do you bring some gifts along ? 
neutral," That's for sure . Fruit , cream cakes , medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives , and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . All this , of course , should be well prepared beforehand . "
neutral, Is it the same practice for all families ? 
neutral," Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday . "
neutral, I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings . The holiday's long enough for you to relax . 
neutral, Don't you spend a lot of money then ? 
neutral, Take it easy . We should be able to make it unless we get caught in a traffic jam . 
neutral, I think perhaps I need to buy a few years while I figure out about my career . 
neutral, thank you so much for your advice . I'll think it over . 
neutral, Don't worry . The traffic is smooth . You will be there in time for your flight . 
neutral,"Where to , sir ? "
neutral, This is our courtyard . 
neutral," It's so spacious , about 40 square metres , right ? "
neutral," Yes , about 46 square metres . "
neutral, I'm planning to return to China after graduation . 
neutral, Are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch ? 
neutral," It'll take awhile , but I'm working on it . "
neutral, Very beautiful and very interesting . But why do you hang them in the tree ? 
neutral, You just have to build up a tolerance . I used to be like that . But your body gets used to it . 
neutral," where are you going to work then , in Australia or back in China ? "
neutral, Very good idea . Sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness . 
neutral, I'm going to graduate this summer . 
neutral,how was your education going on in Australia ? 
neutral," About the same . But I'm looking for a job , so I have to answer the phone often . "
neutral,"Hello , this is David . "
neutral, Sure ! How about the coffee shop right across the street from my office ? 
neutral, That will work . 
neutral, Does five thirty work for you ? 
neutral, That will be fine . What I have to show you will only take a few minutes of your time . 
neutral, Is it the plans for my new house ? 
neutral, Yes . I just need to double check a few details with you . 
neutral,What stresses you out the most ? 
neutral, Probably my parents . 
neutral, How so ? 
neutral," Well , during school , they wanted good grades . Then after I got a job , they wanted me to get a better job . And finally , they want me to get married . "
neutral, You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents . 
neutral, Your parents are not like that ? 
neutral, Beijing University . Do you know where it is located ? 
neutral, Really ? Do I have to do it ? 
neutral," Hi David , this is Marge . Can you meet me after work for a few minutes ? "
neutral, You're welcome . 
neutral, Will do . 
neutral,Hi ! Do you know what's for dinner ? I'm starving ! 
neutral," Let me see ... The weekend after next looks pretty good.Otherwise , I'm all booked up . "
neutral," I want some exciting . Which is more fun , the roller coaster or the ferris wheel ? "
neutral, really ? It sounds interesting . 
neutral, I like neither . 
neutral, it must be very demanding . 
neutral, Really ? My name is Gretchen Hammer . What is your name ? 
neutral, My name is Phillip Hammer . I think we are related . Who is your dad ? 
neutral, not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life . 
neutral,What do you want to eat today ? 
neutral," you mean you got working experience , right ? "
neutral, of course . There ’ s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world . 
neutral, Yes . They are over there . 
neutral, that ’ s true . I ’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job ? 
neutral,"Excuse me , sir , may I take your order now ? "
neutral," We're planning a weekend camping trip , and we want to know which weekend is best for everyone . "
neutral,"Excuse me , do you sell apples ? "
neutral," No , you don't have to . "
neutral, Yeuks ! Do they know anything about me ? 
neutral," Absolutely ! If you come to our class , I am sure you will like him . "
neutral," Actually , I've told them a lot about you . They are excited to meet you . "
neutral,"John , why don ’ t you go and do some gardening ? The lawn needs weeding . "
neutral, I feel the same way . 
neutral, I'm a little nervous ! 
neutral," Because I ’ m not in the mood , that ’ s why . "
neutral, Could we order later ? We have five persons altogether and 2 of us are still on the way . 
neutral, I think you'll like them . My family is pretty laid back . 
neutral, How Ay people will be there at dinner ? 
neutral, Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ? 
neutral," That's good , I'm usually more comfortable in bigger families . "
neutral," yeah , but I ’ m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset . "
neutral," OK , I see . "
neutral," Follow me , please . "
neutral, great . I ’ m looking forward to it . 
neutral,Can you speak French ? 
neutral, Fun for you ! Do you get to do anything you want ? 
neutral, Yep . And I should start planning now . 
neutral, Does everyone usually show up for your family reunions ? 
neutral, Just about . There are at least a few hundred in our immediate family alone . 
neutral, How Ay days will the reunion be ? 
neutral, It is a red Audi . 
neutral, Do you sell them individually or by weight ? 
neutral, This is going to be a major production for you ! 
neutral, What are you going to enjoy ? 
neutral, Take the magazines out of the bookcase . Put them in that box . 
neutral,Can you vouch for me that I was with you yesterday ? 
neutral," Well , the books are in the box . What can I do now ? "
neutral, Why do I need to do that ? 
neutral, Take the books out of the bookcase . Put them in this box . 
neutral," Sure , what's going on ? "
neutral," Oh , my goodness . Who do I need to talk to ? "
neutral,What can I do ? 
neutral, My employer . Can you come in to the office tomorrow ? 
neutral, Absolutely . I think I still have the boarding passes from our flight here somewhere . 
neutral, I ’ m serious . 
neutral, Don't you want to hear more about my statue ? 
neutral, How much is my stamp ? 
neutral," About 40 percent , if he speaks slowly.When he speaks fast , I can only catch a word here and there . But Mr . Wang is an excellent Chinese teacher.With his help , my Chinese is getting better and better e "
neutral," More or less . How well do you understand Mr . Wang , your Chinese teacher ? "
neutral, That would be the real proof . Didn't we have to show ID to get on the plane ? 
neutral, Can you understand your Spanish teacher ? 
neutral, Since 911 I think every airline requires that the passengers show ID to board . 
neutral, I'm back . My bid on the Buddha is still the highest ! 
neutral," Yes , I can , but not very well . "
neutral,"Jack , could you check your calendar ? "
neutral, Are you able to follow him ? 
neutral," Anything else I can do for you , sir ? "
neutral," Yes , thank you . "
neutral, I think you can say your seventh great grandfather ! Cutie ! What's his name ? 
neutral, I'm so glad you can finally see things in my way . Can we leave this dull place now ? 
neutral," For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play . "
neutral, Are you a football player ? 
neutral, It doesn't matter . This one is fine . 
neutral," No , I just for fun with my friends . We play two hand touch or flag football . We're too old to play tackle football . "
neutral, What is two hand touch and flag football ? 
neutral," Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing . "
neutral," That's right , once a week . Do you want to order a Pizza ? "
neutral,Taxi ! 
neutral, You mean this is going to be a regular thing ? 
neutral, Yep . They said they're reviving an old tradition . 
neutral, Dad and Mom ? 
neutral, But they are not as convenient as the subway . 
neutral, Great . 
neutral, Yeah . I heard a lot about it . Is it really that fun ? 
neutral,Hey Steve . When's the next time you're going to play golf ? 
neutral, I'm going out this Saturday . 
neutral, Do you already have a foursome ? 
neutral, I can see people who are walking on the sidewalk . I can see cars driving on the streets . I can see the sun shining and beautiful flowers dancing in the wind . I can even smell the scent of flowers and the freshness of the air . 
neutral," Unfortunately , we do . Let's plan for something together for Wednesday . We can go right after work . "
neutral, That sounds good . Where do you want to play ? 
neutral," We won't have much time , so let's play somewhere close to work . "
neutral, How about Bellevue ? It's pretty close . 
neutral, How much does it cost over there ? 
neutral," You know , on a date . They're going to dinner . "
neutral," OK , let me think . The roller coaster looks more fun . "
neutral, That's pretty good . Let's do it . 
neutral, Aright . I'll get a tee time for Wednesday at about 4 
neutral, I like ferris wheel more . 
neutral, We're on our own tonight . Dad's taking mom out . 
neutral, Would you like to clear the table then ? 
neutral, Where do we pay the fare ? 
neutral, It's a very popular game in America . 
neutral, How about football ? 
neutral," Well , don ’ t just sit there , do something . Come and help me in the kitchen . "
neutral," Yes , and seven days a week . "
neutral, cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar ! 
neutral, Yes . Does it operate night and day ? 
neutral, Really ? 
neutral, OK . There is no subway in my city . 
neutral, He was . He was friendly toward and showed concern for everyone he met . 
neutral,What sport do you like the most ? 
neutral, Come on . Here is for enjoying and exciting . 
neutral," Help you in the kitchen , I don ’ t feel like it . "
neutral, I am sorry . That table has been booked . 
neutral, I like baseball the best . 
neutral, Me too . Did you play when you were a kid ? 
neutral, Yeah . I played until I graduated from high school . 
neutral," In my country football is brand new , so I never learned the game when I was younger . "
neutral, What position did you play ? 
neutral," oh , it ’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ? "
neutral, I hate third base . It's scary when the ball is coming at you so fast . 
neutral, part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ? 
neutral," It was scary at first , but after awhile , I got used to it . If you have fast reflexes , then it's not really a problem . What position did you play ? "
neutral, I played outfield . I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces . 
neutral," Yes , it's far quicker and less complicated . "
neutral," I'm on a softball league . It's not fast pitch , but it's still fun . You wanna join our group ? "
neutral, When do you guys play ? 
neutral,Shall we go to the library by subway ? 
neutral, Sounds pretty fun . I'll come out and join you next time . 
neutral,"hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ? "
neutral, What about the tickets ? I've already bought them . 
neutral,What sports do you like to play ? 
neutral, I like baseball and basketball . 
neutral," I think I tried every position , but the last few years , I played third base . "
neutral,"Excuse me , Is this the bus I should take to get to the Central Park ? "
neutral, Yes . But you have to transfer to Bus No . 28 . 
neutral," Well , for city dwellers , the Spring Festival is a holiday of seven days . While in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized , the festival lasts ten days . "
neutral," Well , don't get bend on a ship about it . "
neutral, That would be great . I would love some . 
neutral," No , I'm not . "
neutral, You've got be joking . 
neutral, Maybe I could help . 
neutral,We're having a tailgate party I before the game . Would you like to join us ? 
neutral," Okay . Get back to your work , and call me back this evening . "
neutral, Right ! And I have to finish the report by 5:30 p . m . 
neutral, How fun ! Can I bring something ? 
neutral, Don't worry about it ! Just come at five . 
neutral, Is your boss coming by ? 
neutral,"Hey , Jack , I'd better go now . "
neutral, Then I'll see you in the parking lot at five ! Thank you ! 
neutral,When do you want to have the open house party ? 
neutral," Okay , no problem . Bye ! "
neutral,"Will you give me a hand , sir ? "
neutral, Friday sounds good .

neutral, No problem . 
neutral, Do you feel like a king in your castle ? 
neutral, Leave me alone ! 
neutral," Sorry , sir . We receive credit card and cash only . "
neutral,I'm really curious . What is it like doing housework all day for a living ? 
neutral, what question ? 
neutral, Just get out of my face ! 
neutral, Here is my card . 
neutral," It's a little like being a mom , only I get paid for it ! "
neutral, I don't want to talk about it . 
neutral, Could you deliver it tomorrow ? 
neutral, Bye ! 
neutral, why didn ’ t you answer my question ? 
neutral," Sorry , Sally , it's not your fault . "
neutral," Give me your water and electricity bills , please . "
neutral, Let me see ... it's $ 50 . 
neutral, Don't brother me ! 
neutral,Do you love me ? 
neutral, I ’ m very fond of you . 
neutral, Won't he be surprised ! 
neutral," Yes , but do you love me ? "
neutral," Aw , Mom . I don't want fruit , Aren't there any chocolate chips ? "
neutral," Well , why don't you have some fruit instead ? "
neutral," I know , but I'm hungry . "
neutral, I don't know how old he is though . 
neutral, Cookies ? You just ate an hour ago . 
neutral,"Mom , have we got any cookies ? "
neutral,"hello , Kate ! How are you doing ? "
neutral, why ? You mean a lot to me . 
neutral, That's O . K . Maybe his wife will spill the beans ! 
neutral,Hello . Are you a friend of Helen's ? 
neutral," to be honest with you , Jason , I don't think I'm doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job . I'm always two steps behind . I've got to get back to the dorm and continue writing tha "
neutral, You ought to complain.These machine are always out of order . 
neutral," Actually , a friend of a friend . "

neutral, I know but I was busy with my part-time job the last few days .

neutral, fine . How are your term papers ? 
neutral," fine , thanks . How are you ? "
neutral,"Hello , what can I do for you ? "
neutral, my advisor ? 
neutral, That's easy . Anything else ? 
neutral, Nothing . 
neutral, How Ay clients do you have already ? 
neutral, you know that I care for you . I---I ’ m proud of you . 
neutral, My girlfriend just broke up with me . 
neutral, Were there any animals in the forest ? 
neutral," No , they've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away . "
neutral, Really ? There aren't many left now . 
neutral," Don ’ t cherish your words , dear . "
neutral, No . 
neutral, It was that final sprint ! You were great ! Really ! 
neutral, Of course not.There are so many people here today . 
neutral, I---I don ’ t feel like saying it . 
neutral,Who did the stupid thing ? 
neutral, Yeah . 
neutral, what is the purpose of your stay ? 
neutral, You've been through this too ? 
neutral," Yes , I can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds.But nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here . "
neutral, Yes . I can't even find a seat . 
neutral, But it hurts too much . 
neutral," I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls . "
neutral, I'll be here for about a year . 
neutral, how long will you be staying in the UK ? 
neutral," no , I don't have anything to declare . "
neutral, What if I don't want to find another girl ? 
neutral, It's sapphire . We have only one brooch of this type . Will you try it on ? 
neutral, What is this made of ? 
neutral," Yes , I would . "
neutral, do you have anything to declare ? 
neutral,Would you show me this brooch ? 
neutral, I won't . 
neutral," I see . Yes , you'll need to renew your passport in a few months . Make sure you don't let it expire while you are in the UK . "
neutral," 3,500 yuan . "
neutral," OK , sir . We will be there right now ... sir , your table is ready . "
neutral, That's exactly why my business is doing so well ! 
neutral,"Excuse me , madam . Is this seat taken ? "
neutral," Do you love me ? come on , I ’ m eager to hear . "
neutral,"Hi.Ed , what's up ? "
neutral," Well , I've been in business for one month now and I have ten clients . "
neutral, This machine is out of order . 
neutral, Wow . Too bad I don't have a clue about housework . 
neutral, How soon do you want it ? 
neutral, I would like to order 2 office-style cabinets and desk calendars . We want office-style cabinets in white . The catalogue number is 90 - f - 2356 . 
neutral,"Can I help you , Miss ? "
neutral," Oh , yes . Any kind of goods are dependable as our shop is well-known throughout the city . "
neutral," It is genuine , isn't it ? "
neutral, How about this one ? This is 500 yuan and the same kind of material as that one . 
neutral, It's expensive for me . 
neutral, What's the matter ? 
neutral," Oh , no . "
neutral, Only 700 yuan . 
neutral, I'll be studying . I'm doing an MBA at Nottingham University . 
neutral," Yes , I will . But how much is it ? "
neutral, It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow . I admire the bravery of plum blossoms . 
neutral, But it used to be ignored by many people . 
neutral,"Hey , Jim , you're 15 minutes late . What's up ? "
neutral, I got stuck in a traffic jam . 
neutral, The bright people will remember it forever . 
neutral, how do you plan on paying for your living costs and tuition fees while you are here ? 
neutral," Well , it's snowing . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing . "
neutral,What date is today ? 
neutral, Why ? 
neutral, Didn't you notice the roses everywhere ? 
neutral, I have a housing contract with the university . I'll be in a dorm room on campus . 
neutral," Oh , God . I just forgot it . I should have brought roses for my girlfriend . "
neutral, where will you be staying ? 
neutral, It's not too late . Go to buy some now . 
neutral, thank you very much . 
neutral, Here they are . 
neutral, You should pay 160 yuan for the electricity fee and 80 yuan for the water fee . 
neutral, Do you mean that I should pay 240 yuan in total ? 
neutral, Maybe we can make reservations ahead of time ? 
neutral, You're welcome . 
neutral,Can I pay my bill here ? 
neutral, do you think it will work ? 
neutral,"Bob , you're so lucky that you've come at the right time-the 2005 International Tourism Festival is around the corner . "
neutral, We've heard about that festival before . It would be quite helpful if you could give us some highlights of the festival . 
neutral," My pleasure . Well , the festival is going to start on the third Saturday of October , and covers over one hundred diverse programs in one month . "
neutral, What do you think we can see during the festival ? 
neutral," I don't know what to suggest . There're so many attractions , and they all sound interesting . One exciting program might be the Ten Thousand People Cycling round the Town . You can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations . "
neutral, I'd like to take the one that goes to the Wild Animal Park . 
neutral," Then you can take Route No . 5 . Next I would suggest the International Dragon Boat Race where you can watch Lion Dance , Dragon Boat racing , and many other water shows . "
neutral," just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding . And more importantly , you can manage both your study and the job . "
neutral," Wow , must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete a-gainst one another on the city river . "
neutral," I ’ ll try , but what if she insists ? "
neutral, I'll double check the announcement . 
neutral, I agree with you but I think you really need to talk to your mother and tell her what's on your mind . 
neutral, You mean as in Sylvester Stallone ? 
neutral, Where should I change for the Park ? 
neutral," No , you idiot . I mean the poet , Arthur Rimbaud - R , I , M , B , A , U , D . "
neutral,I have an idea for Christmas this year . 
neutral," Well , isn ’ t there anything you want ? "
neutral, How much can you drink ? 
neutral, Only when I go out . I'm not a big drinker . 
neutral," I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake . But I ’ m a senior now , I don ’ t want to miss the chance this time . "
neutral, Couple times a week . How about you ? 
neutral, Hear me out . We can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it ! 
neutral, But you may have some trouble convincing the kids . 
neutral, How frequently do you drink ? 
neutral, Now we know that they realize the real meaning of Christmas . 
neutral,Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ? 
neutral,"He's been compared to Rimbaud , you know . "
neutral, that may be true . But I ’ m sure you ’ re able to find a balance between them . Why not try it ? 
neutral, Do you know the day they plan to open ? 
neutral,I'll always remember my college days . 
neutral,"Jared , I just heard about your father . How is he doing ? "
neutral, He's in the hospital resting . The doctor's didn't give a clear answer yet . 
neutral, I'm so sorry to hear that . But this is a good hospital . I'm sure they will do whatever they can . 
neutral, It must be Kate . 
neutral,Who did the stupid thing ? 
neutral, sounds like you're happy with your decision . 
neutral, I hope so . 
neutral, You must feel really worried right now . But you know your dad is a fighter . 
neutral, Yeah . I think my mom is the most worried . I'm basically worried about how she is doing . 
neutral, Where is she right now ? 
neutral," I was planning to attend gradate school , but then I was offered a good job doing marketing , so I changed my mind . "
neutral, It's my dream . 
neutral, She's in the hospital with my dad . I have to go back tonight . 
neutral," Hey , I'll go with you . "
neutral, Thank you . I'll have a try . 
neutral, You don't have to . 
neutral, Ok . Let's go right after dinner . 
neutral,My name's McDonald . 
neutral," Is that spelt M , A , C or M , C ? "
neutral, what did you do after graduation ? 
neutral, I'm usually drinking all night long . At least 10 drinks . 
neutral,There is a new restaurant opening up in town next month . 
neutral, How much can you drink ? 
neutral," it was a round day for me . My family attend the graduation ceremony . I was so nervous . I couldn't find my cap and gown , but all worked out in the end . "
neutral, Then I recommend this package to you . You can receive all the calls free by paying just 10 yuan a month . 
neutral, You're a light weight . 
neutral," It was one of the best times in my life . It was tough , but I made it . I became a college graduate . "
neutral, I usually only have 2 beers . 
neutral, That's good . How can I order it ? 
neutral, I can hardly wait ! 
neutral, It's really no problem . 
neutral," Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L . "
neutral, Of course . 
neutral,"I'll see you in Sterlet , then . "
neutral, Could you commend me some moisturizers ? 
neutral, This way please . We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers . 
neutral," Yes , I want to go out . Would you like to come ? "
neutral," I'm dead serious about this , Sally . "
neutral, We want to look at some of your products . 
neutral," You can't do that , Jenny ! "
neutral, I'm thinking of dropping out . 
neutral,Welcome . How can I help you ? 
neutral, But I don't know which stop is Tinge Depot . 
neutral," That's too bad , anyway , I'm sure things will turn around next master . "
neutral, My pleasure . 
neutral," I get 250 yuan from you , and this is the change , 10 yuan . "
neutral," Cash , please . Here is the money . "
neutral, I'm signing off . 
neutral," Your T-zone gets oily easily , but your cheeks are dry in winter . Am I right ? "
neutral, Don't worry . I won't . 
neutral," No , why should I ? I don ’ t feel like it . Besides , I ’ m in such a bad mood . "
neutral, I'm just asking . It's not like I'd actually make a bid . 
neutral," 120 British pounds . But there are still three days left in the auction . If you want it , you'll have to bid . Do you have the guts ? "
neutral," Yeah , but nothing was clear during the test . "
neutral, Yes . Will you pay by cash or credit card ? 
neutral, No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ? 
neutral,"Are you going to tell me about the stamp , or not ? "
neutral," So , what's the problem ? "
neutral, ( At the zoo ) Wow ! This zoo is really huge . 
neutral," Yes , you can find hundreds of various animals here . It is the biggest zoo in Taiwan . "
neutral," Look at the map . It has different areas , such as marine lives , mammals , polar animals and insects . "
neutral, Where can find the pandas ? I think we are here to see the pandas . 
neutral, We have to go to the mammal area . We are at the gate right now . We need to go straight from here and turn left and go along to the end and make anotherleft turn . 
neutral, It should take at least 20 minutes to get there . Are there any shuttle buses running place to place around the whole zoo ? 
neutral, Just don't come looking to me for help . 
neutral," Yes , that's right . "
neutral," Come on , let's talk about it . "
neutral, How much is the charge ? 
neutral, she says a part-time job is cursed blessing . It takes so much time and energy that I won ’ t be able to focus on my studys . 
neutral, why ? It ’ s unfair . You can learn a lot from it . 
neutral, it ’ s a great opportunity . You should be happy with the offer . 
neutral," oh , Iris , it ’ s about the job with the PR company . "
neutral,"why are you so upset today , Maria ? Cheer up ! "
neutral," Certainly . Ok , got you . "
neutral, Where did you say ? 
neutral, here's Lisa . May I take a picture with her ? 
neutral," Sterlet . It's spelt 0 , S , T , E , R , L , E , Y . "
neutral, Right . 
neutral, it doesn't matter . Say'cheese ' . 
neutral,Do you have a copy of our service contract with Telecoms ? I'm not happy with their response time and I'd like to check the terms and conditions of the contract . 
neutral, hold it a second . I want to fix my hairpin . 
neutral, Depending on what you consider a lot . 
neutral," Mary , don't move . Stand right there . It's a good shot . The background is very pretty . "
neutral," Yes , sir . "
neutral," well , most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service , but some of the education majors have had them made , because they will be faculty members , and they'll need them f "
neutral, the end of all the hard work for my master's . what a nice feeling to get my degree ! 
neutral," This "" Cream of Olives "" is our bestseller for combination skin . You can try it on your hand . "
neutral, do you want to attend the convocation ? 
neutral," certainly . After years of hard work , I wouldn't miss it . By the way , where can I find cap and gown ? "
neutral, do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them ? 
neutral," Oh , very good . I will buy this one . "
neutral, By weight . 6.0 cents per pound . 
neutral," oh , I think they're provided by the school for that special day . "
neutral, no . those you have to provide for yourself . 
neutral, what do most of the students do ? 
neutral,"The telephone is ringing . Can you answer it , Sue ? "
neutral," OK , I'll get it . It's for you , Jeff . "
neutral, At Tinge Depot . 
neutral,Do you drink much ? 
neutral, All right . Anything else ? 
neutral," Could you weigh these , please ? "
neutral, I feel like having some dumplings . Let's go out to eat . 
neutral," $ 4.55 , please . Anything else ? "
neutral," Yes , of course . I need your student ID please . "
neutral,Excuse me ? Is this where I register ? I ’ d like to sign up for my courses for next semester . 
neutral," I can imagine ! I tend to faint when I see blood , so I think I won ’ t be taking up a course like that anytime soon ! "
neutral," Well , they took us along with some paramedics.There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures . His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital . It was intense ! "
neutral, Have you treated any real emergencies ? 
neutral, Can I see the rainbow ? 
neutral, Hi George ! It's good to see you ! 
neutral," For sure ! I mean we ’ Ve learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding , how to check for a pulse , and even how to apply CPR ! "
neutral, What have you been up to ? 
neutral, Cool ! I ’ Ve always wanted to do something like that ! Have you learned anything useful ? 
neutral, I just opened up my own business not long ago . 
neutral, I ’ Ve been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross . 
neutral, Good for you ! What are you doing ? 
neutral," Yes , I'll have a boiled egg with toast and orange juice , please . "
neutral, Here you are . 
neutral,May I take your order now ? 
neutral," I think a six is your size . How do you like these ? I can recommend them , they're very reliable . "
neutral," Well , there is that , yes . "
neutral," Six and a quarter , I believe , but you'd better measure my hand to make sure . "
neutral," I got it a while ago , but I haven't worn it much . You really like it ? "
neutral, I highly doubt it . Your girlfriend is Chinese . 
neutral, Don ’ t ! Stay the course ! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful . I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice . 
neutral," I guess so , but I think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes . "
neutral, Yeah . It's beautiful . Is it white gold or silver ? 
neutral, It's white gold . 
neutral, Where did you buy it ? 
neutral," Well , I think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . You ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture . "
neutral," That ’ s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia , except me . There are a few South Koreans , several Japanese , Malaysian , Thai , Singaporean , Filipino , Kazakhstan , and o "
neutral, My boyfriend took me to the Shane Co . and he let me pick it out . 
neutral," That ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ’ s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian , "
neutral,"Hey , Joe ! Where have you been these past few days ? "
neutral, That's so sweet . What was the occasion ? 
neutral, His girlfriend broke up with him . 
neutral, I have no idea . Maybe she had a fight with her husband . 
neutral," I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really . arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . "
neutral," No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ? "
neutral, I got it on sale down at the department store . 
neutral, When did you go there ? 
neutral," I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . "
neutral, I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ? 
neutral," Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! "
neutral, Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles . 
neutral," If I remember correctly , there's a quiz show . "
neutral," Wow , you are going to be busy this semester ! Okay , here you go . You are registered now . you ’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start . "
neutral, I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection . 
neutral, Do you want to watch it ? 
neutral, That's a good idea . Some of your ties are pretty outdated . 
neutral, Let's see what else is on first . 
neutral,Jack's been looking unhappy lately . 
neutral," Well , I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made , so I couldn't afford to buy any new ties . "
neutral," Yes , I am . Say , are you going to wear that outfit to the party ? "
neutral, I don't think so . It is a little too formal . I'm probably going to wear something more laid back . 
neutral, Me too . I will probably go dressed in a T-shirt and jeans . 
neutral, I guess that you will really be dressing down . 
neutral, How would you like your eggs ? 
neutral, Good point . I suppose that we all have our own individual styles . 
neutral,"Hey , Steven . What are you going to do this Saturday ? "
neutral,"Susan , I haven't seen you in the pub for a long time . "
neutral," If the weather is good , I'll go to climb mountains . "
neutral, Yes . I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology . 
neutral," Okay , Susan . It says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year . Is this information correct ? "
neutral," I have a part-time job now , so I work in the evenings . "
neutral, That explains it . 
neutral,What's wrong with Debbie today ? She seems upset about something . 
neutral," Anyways , are you going to the party tonight ? "
neutral," Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . "
neutral, That's the best part . It wasn't for anything special . He just wanted to buy me something . 
neutral," Mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester . "
neutral,"Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ? "
neutral," That ’ s great , because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves . I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones . "
neutral," Oh , aren't you afraid ? "
neutral, The interesting thing is to see what really works and what's just hype . 
neutral, Because you can see the results with the general public ? 
neutral, Is this the right counter for gloves ? 
neutral,May I help you ? 
neutral, Really ? What else have you discovered ? 
neutral," In the future , that could be possible . "
neutral," In that case , shall I ask the waiter to bring you a knife and fork ? "
neutral," Well , I don't think I can manage with it . "
neutral, Peter ! Pack them . Don't read them . 
neutral," According to the article , you have no real need to worry . Research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts , not on recreating a whole human . "
neutral, I ’ m not sure I like the idea of that . I don ’ t want people copying me or other people . It could be very confusing . 
neutral, You have done a lot of traveling . I'll bet you've learned quite a bit . 
neutral, There are several interesting articles on recent scientific breakthroughs . I just finished reading one about cloning . 
neutral,What are you reading about in that science magazine ? 
neutral, Ok . That sounds like a deal . 
neutral, Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people . 
neutral," Of course not . For me , mountaineering is both relaxation and a hobby . "
neutral, Will it be an all day event ? 
neutral, It would take a lot less time .. 
neutral, Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library . 
neutral,Can you show me how to use chopsticks ? 
neutral, I'll do my best . 
neutral, Can't we go faster ? 
neutral, We are really in a hurry . 
neutral, That ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first . 
neutral, There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that ! 
neutral, I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all . 
neutral," Oh , it is not easy to learn ! "
neutral," You're so lucky . If he bought you something for no special day , I wonder what he would buy you for your birthday . "
neutral," Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this "
neutral, All of the time tested healthy habits from around the world . 
neutral, My birthday is coming up . We'll find out pretty soon . 
neutral, What do you want ? 
neutral," I wouldn't mind a necklace . I was at the jewelry shop looking around , and they have a couple of beautiful necklaces I want . "
neutral,Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students ! 
neutral, Why not a ring ? 
neutral, Certainly . What size do you take ? 
neutral," Well , let me see some of each . "
neutral," That's ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any "
neutral, Are you going with your friends ? 
neutral, Akha . 
neutral," Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ? "
neutral, Is that better ? 
neutral," It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b "
neutral, It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home ! 
neutral," Chinese , maths , English , chemistry , physics , biology and so on . "
neutral,Do you have any year-end benefits ? 
neutral," I just saw a piece of news , that a group of white color workers hold a flour war in the office because of dissatisfaction of the year-end benefits . "
neutral, It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it.Show me what you ’ Ve done . 
neutral, Why they hold a flour war ? 
neutral," They got rice , flour and oil as presents , while the leadership got 1000 yuan shopping card . "
neutral, They are not feeling satisfied ? 
neutral," That depends . If you are lucky , you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks . "
neutral, Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ? 
neutral,What courses are you taking ? 
neutral," Of course , otherwise you ’ ll just have to wait for hours . "
neutral," Yes , madam . What sort of gloves do you want ? "
neutral, But how guilty to waste food ! 
neutral,I think I'll write a book . 
neutral, What about ? 
neutral,How smart of you to book the tickets before hand ! 
neutral, I don ’ t know till now . 
neutral," My train will leave at 3:00 , I'll have to arrive there before 2:50 . "
neutral," Hard-boiled , please . "
neutral, A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me . 
neutral," Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress . "
neutral, I'm watching TV . 
neutral,What are you doing ? 
neutral, I'd love to . 
neutral," First , put away your toys . "
neutral," You're welcome , Diane . I hope you can visit us again soon . "
neutral, We may come at 6:30 p . m . 
neutral, Could I have a few more minutes ? 
neutral," Chen Liang , a table for four . And when are you coming ? "
neutral, I'm Chen Liang . 
neutral," All right . Your name , please . "
neutral, I've got three guests today . We'd like a table next to the window . 
neutral, Good for you ! 
neutral," Yes , of course . "
neutral," Oh . I am sorry , here you are . May I suggest our lunch special ? "
neutral,May I have a reservation ? 
neutral, Of course . I will be here minutes later . 
neutral, Are you serious ? 
neutral, I ’ Ve been accepted ! 
neutral, What does it say ? 
neutral, It ’ s my acceptance letter from UCLA . 
neutral, What is it ? 
neutral, It will be the best as long as the weatherman is right . 
neutral, Give it to me . 
neutral,You got a letter in the mail . 
neutral, I ’ m just going to keep going to PCC . 
neutral,"David , I heard you lost your job . "
neutral," So , what are you going to do ? "
neutral,Is there a vacant table for two now ? 
neutral, You have a point . 
neutral, OK . 
neutral, Surely . You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls . The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty . 
neutral," Thanks . I ’ m proud of myself , too . "
neutral," I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program . "
neutral, Sure . It's an issue asking for everyone's participation . 
neutral,I'm tired . 
neutral," Well , you've been working on this assignment for five hours . "
neutral," Yeah , I need to take a break . "
neutral, You can ’ t be serious ! 
neutral,"May I have the menu , please ? "
neutral, What does it say ? 
neutral, It really gets me interested . Is it higher than Kiang Shan ? 
neutral,You wouldn't believe what happened to me today . 
neutral, It ’ s from NYU . 
neutral, What is it ? 
neutral, What ? 
neutral, Which Channel is it ? 
neutral, Tingling is on TV . 
neutral,"Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don't you just sit and watch ? "
neutral, Are there any good programs on TV ? 
neutral, I had a wonderful time . 
neutral,"Bob , you look pale . What happened ? "
neutral,You got a letter in the mail . 
neutral, Calm down . 
neutral, I didn't sleep a wink last night . 
neutral, Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned ! Maybe I can help you . 
neutral,I'm so angry . I feel like killing someone . 
neutral, Here are $ 40 . Keep the change . That's my tip for you . 
neutral,"Do you want to help me make the cookies , Anna ? "
neutral," All right , I will explain it to you later on . Now scram . "
neutral," Well , I'm under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me two projects . Now the deadlines are near and I still haven't finish one of them . "
neutral," Don't be so irritable . I just don't understand the program , that's all . "
neutral, Then stay away . No one is keeping you from doing that . 
neutral, Is there anything I can do for you ? 
neutral, Give it to me . 
neutral," And your toast , light or dark ? "
neutral, PCC is a wonderful institution . 
neutral," Yeah , you remember that assignment I wanted ? When I heard the manager had given it to someone else , I blew my top . So the manager fired me . "
neutral," Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality . "
neutral, Will there be anything else ? 
neutral, Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ? 
neutral,What's on Channel 12 at 8: 00 ? 
neutral," Www , man ! "
neutral," Well , we would like to sit over there . Is that all right ? "
neutral, Do we get a day off from school then ? 
neutral," No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day . "
neutral, I think he had water on the brain . This is bad . 
neutral, He said there are only all kinds of good weather . 
neutral, Cinct de mayo ? 
neutral," Okay , Pollyanna , what's so good about this weather ? "
neutral," Well , for one , we have an excuse to stay home . "
neutral, We ' get ' to stay home ? Do you know something that I don't ? 
neutral, And then what happened ? 
neutral,"Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ? "
neutral," Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? "
neutral," Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ? "
neutral, Of course . 
neutral,Why are you always staring at Melissa ? Do you like her or something ? 
neutral, Mind your own business . 
neutral,There's a typhoon coming . 
neutral, Is that right ? 
neutral, Later will do . 
neutral," There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH ! "
neutral, Now or later ? 
neutral," Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ? "
neutral," Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says . "
neutral, It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff . 
neutral," Dark , please . "
neutral, I know that there is hot chocolate in the kitchen and some new Cds just waiting for us . 
neutral, That ’ s not a bad idea . 
neutral,I hate this kind of weather ! 
neutral,"Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ? "
neutral, You might as well stay here . 
neutral, PCC is perfectly fine for me . 
neutral," Yes , sir , let me show you the table . This way please . "
neutral," Well , that'll teach you to control your temper . "
neutral, You honestly have no idea ? 
neutral,"Hello , I'm Jack . Are you Christina ? "
neutral, What school would you like to go to ? 
neutral, I don ’ t have the slightest clue . 
neutral,Do you know where you want to transfer to ? 
neutral," Wait , what are you doing ! You can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base ! "
neutral, I'll get the flour out . 
neutral," Yes I am . Nice to meet you , Jack . "
neutral," Are you from Italy , Christina ? "
neutral," Well , OK . But no French kissing ! "
neutral," Well , as we say , the rest is history ... "
neutral," Really , I went to Munich last week . "
neutral," Just a moment , please . "
neutral," Oh , yes . It is a fantastic city . And I like German food as well . "
neutral," And where are you from , Jack ? "
neutral," Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this ! "
neutral, I am from California in the United States . But I am now studying in England . 
neutral, Let me help you . 
neutral, What are you studying ? 
neutral, Me ! Me ! 
neutral," Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer . "
neutral, What does that mean ? 
neutral, That ’ s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest . 
neutral, That's right . 
neutral, One hard-boiled egg with toast and orange juice to follow . 
neutral, Cardiopulmonary resuscitation ! 
neutral, Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency . 
neutral," I am not sure , sir . Generally we can , but look at the traffic . It's the rush hour . "
neutral, I think you are a quick learner . 
neutral, Thank you . Can we get there in half an hour ? 
neutral, He does . He ’ s good at this genre too . It ’ s a captivating read . 
neutral, I thought he usually wrote horror books . 
neutral,My car has broken down . Could someone come right away and check it ? 
neutral, Where are you now ? 
neutral," It says that traditionally , give something made of paper . "
neutral," Oh , it ’ s the latest novel by ray blue . It ’ s a sic-fi thriller . "
neutral,What are you reading ? 
neutral, I can think of two things made of paper — stationery and money . 
neutral,Guess what I just heard ? 
neutral," I am on Route 80 , a few miles east of the University of Utah . "
neutral, What ? 
neutral, I only buy them if they look particularly interesting . I don ’ t buy any regularly . 
neutral, You must be joking ! 
neutral," Yes , I do . The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month . Do you every buy magazines ? "
neutral, Do you have a subscription ? 
neutral,Did you hear who won the English speech contest ? 
neutral," Yes , they do . But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription . "
neutral," No , who won ? "
neutral, Do you have an online edition of that magazine ? 
neutral," Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for . Besides , I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes . "
neutral, Why don ’ t you find the information on the internet instead ? 
neutral, I buy a computer magazine every month . It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments . 
neutral, I would advise you to enjoy the dish while it is hot . 
neutral,You see that chick over there ? 
neutral,"Here is your spicy diced chicken with peanuts , sir . "
neutral, Yeah . Isn't she hot ? 
neutral, OK . I'll take this one . 
neutral, Just alright ? ! ? She's hot ! 
neutral, Why don't you go talk to her ? 
neutral, So what does it say you should give your wife this first anniversary ? 
neutral, I had no idea that there were specific things that should be given on different anniversaries . 
neutral, We ’ re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ? 
neutral, I like the way that the gifts I get increasingly more lavish . 
neutral, There ’ s an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs . We have a subsidiary company l 
neutral," Quite delicious , especially the pepper steak . "
neutral, Three months . 
neutral, What about that one ? 
neutral, The headlines are all about the presidential election in the united states . Few other stories made the front pages . 
neutral,Are there any interesting articles in today ’ s newspapers ? 
neutral, It ’ s all so interesting . I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class . 
neutral, Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ? 
neutral, I'm glad you like it . It's $ 60 in all . 
neutral,What kind of cuisine do you have ? 
neutral, Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand can you . 
neutral, Maybe it's more exciting not knowing . 
neutral, I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time . 
neutral, There are so many things you have to prepare for . 
neutral, You think she's out of my league ? 
neutral, I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall . 
neutral," You are right , sir . To prepare it , a Sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn reddish brown , and then puts diced chicken breast meat into the pot with other condiments and peanuts . That's why the dish has a bright colour . "
neutral," I think mountaineering is an exciting sport , but a little dangerous . "
neutral, Thank you so much . 
neutral,Did you happen to bring that book that we were talking about yesterday ? 
neutral," Well , it's too close to the door . Is that table reserved ? "
neutral, There are no countries marked on the map . 
neutral, And it must be very particular in cooking . 
neutral,What are you doing ? 
neutral," No , sir . You can sit where you like . "
neutral, This is sure to be a worthwhile read . 
neutral, I want to look at nelson Mandela ’ s autobiography . 
neutral, Yes . It's a traditional dish . 
neutral, Me too . I need something to read on the flight to new york . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ’ s books for her daughter . 
neutral," Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks . "
neutral, I see . 
neutral, Hell no ! You're just a chicken that's all . 
neutral, C'mon . I get nervous when I talk to girls . 
neutral,Do you often buy magazines ? 
neutral, that's right . You should establish good relationships with them . what else are you planning to do while working for that company ? 
neutral, Yes . I'm looking for some perfume . Do you have perfumes with a light scent ? 
neutral," yeah , the success stories of that company might be useful for me . And their customers may become the potential ones for my own company . "
neutral,May I help you ? 
neutral, And humility . I would have liked to meet him personally . 
neutral, What does your car look like ? 
neutral,"Hey , let's arm wrestle ! "
neutral, it can save you lots of time and effort to simply copy a successful business model . 
neutral, Not now . 
neutral, you could say so . I'll work hard in that company and try to understand as much as possible about how to run an enterprise . 
neutral, Are you kidding ? I just feel tired right now . 
neutral,Hey Jack . What's going on ? 
neutral, it sounds like you've got a perfect plan . 
neutral, Really ? When did you decide this ? 
neutral," well , I'll come up with a detailed business plan to attract the investors . "
neutral, I'll do it someday . But it's not the right time now . I have to learn a lot by working as an employee . 
neutral," but you said your dream was to be an entrepreneur , to be your own boss . "
neutral," That's exciting , man . "
neutral, So how did you propose ? 
neutral,I'm going to work in a multi-national enterprise after graduation . 
neutral, You shouldn't use my example . It wasn't special . I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now . 
neutral, What do you think I should do ? 
neutral," There are a lot of options . You can surprise her over dinner , or ask her in a public area , or if you have the balls , ask her father in front of her . "
neutral, I never thought about that . 
neutral, Thought about what ? 
neutral, Asking her father in front of her . How do you think she will react ? 
neutral," A sack of cherries , please . "
neutral," Thanks , John . "
neutral," Yes , I think even though we are adults , it's still a good place for us to relax . "
neutral, These magazines are interesting . May I borrow one ? 
neutral, Here you are .

suprise," you ’ re right . By the way , did you hear that tom inherited some money recently ? "
suprise, I had some good financial news yesterday too . 
suprise, I didn ’ t think about it like that . 
suprise, You know it is not necessary to pay the balance in full every month .

suprise, I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . 
suprise, I ’ m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ’ s simply just too old ! That ’ s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ’ t much I can do .

In addition , you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts . "
suprise,"You married Joe , didn't you ? "
suprise," I have a large family . I have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and my parents . "

suprise," My wife has found that I have an affair with my secretary , and now she is going to divorce me . "
suprise," Hmm ... okay , here ’ s the thing . I ’ Ve always seen you as more than just a friend , and I can ’ t take it any more .

suprise, They turned me down . 
suprise, I often play badminton with my parents . 
suprise," Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche . "
suprise," I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable . "
suprise, In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .

suprise," It ’ s the job I ’ m interested in . And your company is the best-known . Although I don ’ t have much experience as a manager , the job description you sent to me was very interesting . It ’ s a job I ’ Ve been dreaming of and I feel suited to fill it . "
suprise, Didn't tell me what ? What ?

"
suprise,"<surprise>He looked quite nonplussed . <\surprise>
"
suprise," True , but English is harder than most . It's a crazy language . "
suprise," Good ? Yes , it's good for her but not for me . You see , she tells me that I'll feel better about myself if I slim down . She keeps giving me newspaper clippings about the latest miracle diet and insists that I join a health club , as she has . "

suprise, Yes . You must fill up the car yourself .

suprise, Yeah . Is Cindy up ? 
suprise, I got fired . 
suprise," Yes , I haven't seen you for four years.How time flies ! "
suprise,"<surprise>She was totally nonplussed . <\surprise>
