happy, so disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it and breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether 
happy, right a disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music 
happy, and disco a kind of nightclub 
happy, well breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance 
happy, like disco 
happy, according to the story it is some sort of modern dance style 
happy, what does it say 
happy, it is a great idea i ca not believe i did not think of this earlier going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed

happy,how nice it is here 
happy, absolutely bob and his whole family are welcome here any time 
happy, i like spring the days are long and the night are short the flowers are in bloom we go on picnics 
happy, haha jogging perhaps it might be a bit too boring 
happy, that is okay i like it better that way anyway 
happy, well it costs an arm and a leg 30 yuan per person what a costly sport that is why i have to refrain from even thinking about it and i find jogging a very agreeable substitute 
happy, my pleasure let is go and have a drink 
happy, oh well the music has stopped thank you for the dance 
happy,hi i am home can you double that recipe i ran into an old friend after work and invited him for dinner 
happy, disco is my favorite i like it better than any other dances because it can release one is pent up feelings and is a healthy exercise but i do not do the rock and roll and the break dance 
happy, yes and what dances do you do best 
happy, thank you for your compliments it s just that you are a good leader do you like the fox trot and tango 
happy, i am glad you say so you dance beautifully too it is lucky that i got a partner 
happy, oh really but you are doing the waltz wonderfully well 
happy, you know what you wo not get a rush from it until you fully understand it it is a simple sport and does not require skills of any sort this leaves room for me to enjoy the beautiful suburban scenery while jogging fresh air caresses my face and blows into my chest which translates into inspirations inspirations are really good stuff for a writer like me sometimes i even come up with a verse or two 
happy, yes disco dancing is my favorite it s great fun and good exercise as well 
happy, yes

happy, hi vince thanks for stopping by how is the work coming along for the online auction 
happy,morning zina just wanted to say thanks again 
happy, maybe but i d rather be spoiled than turn into a crazy guy with a long period to talk to the birds 
happy, it s true michelle is a lot like henry in so many ways and she is shy with new people just like he is 
happy, well i will be honest and say you will never be as good at bargaining as a local person you are a foreigner and the sellers can see that but if you are smart you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price

happy, he is my brother 
happy, sounds interesting 
happy, temple fair 
happy, exactly but later on he cares more about his career than love work seems to be the better all and all for him so much that he does not even grudge sparing a day out with me

happy, good to meet you mr chettri 
happy, oh hello i am bias chettri 
happy, i would recommend a day at the zoo it is fun for all the family there is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip

neutral, yes i think so when i work overtime i am paid time and a half

neutral, he never does and in fact he seldom communicates with him 
neutral, does he do that with his dad i mean does he complain things to his father

neutral, sounds good see you there 
neutral, i guess you could say that eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy i have lost 5 pounds and i feel great

neutral, no foot gives out scent 
neutral,bob put on your shoes your feet are really smelly 
neutral, i would trade you if i could but i do not think i would be a very convincing macho a 
neutral, next time you are going to love your part i have seen the script 
neutral, i am not at all keen on this subject 
neutral,can i borrow this magazine from you it is really interesting and i ca not put it down 
neutral, yep here it is what do you think 
neutral, that might be going overboard a bit how about just that scarf with a bracelet 
neutral, do not you like to know anything about stocks 
neutral, a light brown suit and a pink tie today and a light blue shirt and a blue tie yesterday a perfect match 
neutral, what a heavy snow 
neutral, seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow that is a good idea let is go

neutral, she would be laughing one moment and if i said something insensitive she would start crying i did not want to deal with that 
neutral, 241 main street

neutral, it is a good idea 
neutral, she was a psycho man one time we were suppose to get together i was waiting for her call and when she finally called she was screaming why i was not at her place 
neutral, were you suppose to be there 
neutral, i thought she was going to call when she was done shopping it was a misunderstanding she was literally screaming on the phone over this

neutral, the one made in the early tang period is bigger and has more characters on it while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late tang period look carefully and tell me if you see the difference now 
neutral, yes they are different but it is too professional what i need is just being able to tell the real from the fake do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin 
neutral, our relationship i mean my friend and i 
neutral, various methods were used in history to produce fake coins we usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines we can judge it with naked eyes 
neutral, i see by the way china was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history did they issue their own coins in china 
neutral, certainly they did liao coins and song coins for example coexisted in circulation during the southern song and yuan period some 800 1000 years ago the liao coins look plain and bold in style just like the characteristics of the mongolian tribe let me look for one and show you 
neutral, if you happen to find one please bargain with the owner for it i would like to have one it is interesting to see the integration of the han and mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal 
neutral,hey jackie what are you doing 
neutral, nothing much i am just relaxing today why what is going on 
neutral, sure 
neutral, i was thinking about heading to the mall do you want to go

neutral, any reasons 
neutral, again 
neutral, how about this scarf these earrings and an anklet 
neutral, that sounds great where should we meet 
neutral, i like the jeans but you need something to go with the top it is too plain on its own 
neutral, sounds good see you there

neutral, they are cute but do you think you will wear them much 
neutral, no not really 
neutral, this sweater is so pretty i love the low neck design 
neutral, i bet it is expensive 
neutral, it is on sale for 80 what do you think should i try it on

neutral, my father dose not know how to tie a tie for he often wears a cravat 
neutral, my father wears a tie every day but he can t do it himself my mother helps him with his tie every morning

neutral, no no i am just thinking of some dessert and i have had enough carrots 
neutral, that is it that is the tradition 
neutral,i am busy year in and year out but now i have done nothing 
neutral, thanks 
neutral, well in fact it is fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing 
neutral, i guess the spirit of it is what really makes any tradition fun 
neutral, you should be there some christmas eve 
neutral, i may have done a lot but none is to my satisfaction 
neutral, what do you mean 
neutral, that s a good idea the counselor is a psychologist he s better trained to handle these sorts of things 
neutral, you must have seen some other kind of bird 
neutral, do not tell me anything about it i want to read it for myself 
neutral, i see

neutral, sounds great shall i learn the actions that jet li did in the movies 
neutral, but i will miss the news it s important in my business to keep up with events in china 
neutral, well that is life 
neutral, how about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night 
neutral, i know you are right but what can i do 
neutral, bill you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing and skipping meals will not help you lose weight in fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals 
neutral, but i work hard all the time for long hours often i have no time for lunch yet i am still getting fatter 
neutral,i will participate in a quiz about the 29th olympic games in beijing it will be held tonight will you come 
neutral, that is just an excuse you can always find some time to exercise 
neutral, sure what do you know about the olympic games on the past for example do you know where and when the first olympic games were held in the ancient times 
neutral, it was held in 776 b c at olympia it also has a long history of more than 2700 years 
neutral,i work so hard that i do not have the energy to exercise 
neutral, have not the olympics been stopped for a long time 
neutral, yes there were no games in 1916 1940 and 1944 because of world war i and world war ii 
neutral, i see look do you know what that emblem means i have seen it so many times but i do not know what it stands for 
neutral, oh it is the beijing 2008 olympics emblem it is a chinese seal meaning that chinese people warmly welcome the friends from all over the world 
neutral, i see i believe there will be lots of foreigners coming to beijing to watch the games 
neutral, you have no idea how proud i am of myself 
neutral, good

neutral, to tell you the truth it is the most tedious course i ever had

neutral,i have been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad i wonder how you managed to achieve such success 
neutral, i am preparing a birthday party for julia 
neutral, but he has to stick to it and to it long enough 
neutral, and he himself is very diligent considering all these i think he has the ball at his feet 
neutral, oh through a lot of hard work of course 
neutral,he has so many friends supporting him 
neutral, i suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first was not it 
neutral, hmm maybe you are right but i ca not stand all this green carpet here and besides i know how to paint i will just cover everything with drop cloth i wo not get anything on the floor 
neutral, that would be great 
neutral, you mean you did not know much english then 
neutral, right i only knew a few english sentences 
neutral, that is incredible could you tell me what you did to make a start 
neutral, first i worked as a servant 
neutral, really i wish you could tell me more about your experience 
neutral, i would like to but i must run to a meeting 
neutral, can i be of any help to you 
neutral, yes but we should hire someone for that that will probably be expensive and it has to be done right 
neutral, absolutely not we can remove the carpet ourselves carpet is held down with carpet nails you just need to pull it hard and it will come up 
neutral, alright then maybe we can do the floor first these wood floors under this carpet are beautiful and me too i ca not wait to get all this old carpet out of here but how can we get it out do we have to hire someone 
neutral, of course could you help to blow up some balloons 
neutral, yes i am sure i have done a lot of house painting in my life and my mother was very picky if i got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture she would get furious so i learned to be very careful 
neutral, i hate balloons 
neutral, are you sure 
neutral, surely it was especially when you only knew few people and little english

neutral, the mayor and high official practice crony is mand a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions 
neutral, sorry i do not smoke 
neutral,excuse me nature calls 
neutral, yes take myself for example i seldom go to cinemas but it does not mean i no longer see films instead i see films at home watching ccds 
neutral,the performance is amazing i am curious about how they did it i mean the way they sing 
neutral, but it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past 
neutral, so cool someone gave me this flier at the exit what is it about 
neutral, let me have a look well it lists some shows that will be on next week 
neutral, oh tell me about it anything interesting 
neutral, hmm oh this one the drunken beauty this is a real classic 
neutral, the drunken beauty it is funny that we have sleeping beauty in my country anyway what is it about is the beauty a drunkard 
neutral, of course not she was said to be the most beautiful woman in her time and that made her become the queen they play was famous for its singing and dancing 
neutral, what is the cause 
neutral, it is train no 249 it will depart in four hours 
neutral,this small town has many serious problems 
neutral, sure people do that when they are drunk what about the actress 
neutral, she is an opera star in china her teacher is teacher is mei landfang 
neutral, what you said is true but the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience for example to make more movie ccds so people will spend money buying them 
neutral, partly and he is also a hardworking man 
neutral, just because he gets on well with everybody 
neutral, yes i bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted 
neutral, you are such an expert on it i do not know that 
neutral,nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films so i am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive 
neutral, are you sure 
neutral, there are a lot of ways to help a kid build up self esteem but to begin with you can try and give him more rewards rewards will help a chil improve his self esteem 
neutral,freeze 
neutral, do not ask me 
neutral,what is a good place for sightseeing 
neutral, what is it 
neutral, no i encourage her to go her own way but she is now having a change of heart 
neutral, did she give up her decision to marry dick 
neutral, sarah and i could see eye to eye with each other 
neutral, oh i did not expect you to know them but yes i love them not only because of many medals they have won but also because of their spirits

neutral, sure what about you what do you like about the olympics

neutral, i always am you just did not notice 
neutral,belinda i m going to a party tonight what shall i wear 
neutral, is it formal or informal 
neutral, how can his he do that 
neutral, i guess it s formal 
neutral, then you should dress well 
neutral, i think perhaps the news stories in it are truthful and accurate it also has a special page about the stock market maybe this is the real reason for its popularity many people are now speculating in the stock market 
neutral, what is the reason that people prefer to read this one 
neutral, you are smart 
neutral, of course the sports shoes don t go with the formal occasions 
neutral, well they are for your wife so i think you should give her roses 
neutral,finding an excuse is obviously down your alley and trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at 
neutral, i would recommend you the morning paper it is true that the paper is a newly issued one but its circulation is rising last month it reached to three hundred thousand which is a very good figure for a new paper 
neutral, roses will be fine 
neutral, she keeps talking when i am reading 
neutral,there are many new kinds of newspapers i find it hard to choose among them which is the most popular paper circulating in our city 
neutral, good idea oh by the way would you please pick me up after the party honey 
neutral, it ll be too late you d better take a taxi 
neutral, ok 
neutral, you are passing the buck i will be hanged if i ask you to go to the park with us 
neutral, this may be complicated but i think he may need to build up his self esteem 
neutral, that will be great 
neutral,you are saying he will be promoted to the general manager 
neutral, what a pity 
neutral, why did you say that it is a good thing for him to live with his son 
neutral, to think of it all my old silver it meant so much to me 
neutral, what fools we were 
neutral,here let me get the door for you 
neutral, just let it be her rudeness will come back to haunt her

neutral, well they re not here they are in the dustbin

neutral, what is his problem 
neutral, maybe but it still gets on my nerves 
neutral, it is not too late pass your ticket to me please 
neutral, i saw her dating with her ex boyfriend again 
neutral, he is doing ok but he pretends he is doing much better by telling lies 
neutral, why not i would love to do that 
neutral, is he doing very well at school 
neutral, wow look at this so delicate and beautiful did ancient chinese people really wear them 
neutral, where is he going

neutral, you are lucky 
neutral, what do you do to deal with the stress 
neutral, i do not know do you have any advice for me

neutral, i want to become a professor a lawyer an editor a civil servant 
neutral, what kind of job do you want after graduation 
neutral, career path i am not sure 
neutral, yes of course i live near the university hop in please 
neutral, do you have a clear career path to follow 
neutral, i am planning to go to graduate school but i also want to find a job otherwise i will have nowhere to go if i fail the entrance exam 
neutral, ever since i brought home some bad grades in elementary school they never expected much 
neutral, no we usually go to places that have specials dante is over on the ave has 5 00 pitchers on mondays so for ten fifteen bucks i can get a lot of drinks 
neutral,you will soon graduate from your university do you have any plans for the future

neutral, how could it be 
neutral, do you bring some gifts along 
neutral, that is for sure fruit cream cakes medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids all this of course should be well prepared beforehand 
neutral, is it the same practice for all families 
neutral, not all the same nowadays i must say many families especially those of newly married couples choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines rose and i had a tour to singapore malaysia thailand and hong kong last year we stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday 
neutral, i really appreciate the way you chinese people exchange feelings the holiday is long enough for you to relax 
neutral, do not you spend a lot of money then

neutral, i highly doubt it your girlfriend is chinese 
neutral, don t stay the course your spoken chinese will be eternally grateful i bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice 
neutral, i guess so but i think it s going to be hard to relate to my classmates especially with the language barrier i think i might change classes 
neutral, yeah it is beautiful is it white gold or silver 
neutral, it is white gold 
neutral, where did you buy it 
neutral, well i think you re pretty lucky actually you ll have the opportunity to learn so much about asian culture 
neutral, that s quite the array of nationalities everyone in my class is from asia except me there are a few south koreans several japanese malaysian thai singaporean filipino kazakhstan and o 
neutral, my boyfriend took me to the shane co and he let me pick it out 
neutral, that s both fortunate and unfortunate it s the united nations in my class we have people from all over the world there are three germans a pole a scottish two french an american a brazilian 
neutral,hey joe where have you been these past few days

neutral, i liked physics it s all math really arcs curves velocity cool stuff 
neutral, no not at all it looks really classy on you where did you pick that up 
neutral, i got it on sale down at the department store 
neutral, when did you go there 
neutral, i was just there a couple of days ago you know you should go down there too they have a lot of stylish clothes on sale 
neutral, i might just do that what style of clothes do they have 
neutral, yeah my head hurts that s all i ve been in physics class all day it s killer 
neutral, anything you want they have both casual and formal styles 
neutral, if i remember correctly there is a quiz show 
neutral, wow you are going to be busy this semester okay here you go you are registered now you ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start 
neutral, i was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection 
neutral, do you want to watch it 
neutral, that is a good idea some of your ties are pretty outdated 
neutral, let is see what else is on first 
neutral,jack is been looking unhappy lately 
neutral, well i spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor made so i could not afford to buy any new ties 
neutral, yes i am say are you going to wear that outfit to the party 
neutral, i do not think so it is a little too formal i am probably going to wear something more laid back 
neutral, me too i will probably go dressed in a t shirt and jeans 
neutral, i guess that you will really be dressing down 
neutral, how would you like your eggs 
neutral, good point i suppose that we all have our own individual styles 
neutral,hey steven what are you going to do this saturday

neutral, anyways are you going to the party tonight 
neutral, yeah yeah but today s lesson was all about the creation of the universe 
neutral, that is the best part it was not for anything special he just wanted to buy me something 
neutral, mine was ok except that no one in my class speaks english i guess it will force me to converse in chinese more in class so at least i should improve a lot this semester 
neutral,hi cody how did practicing go this week 
neutral, that s great because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves i prefer natural remedies to man made ones 
neutral, oh are not you afraid 
neutral, the interesting thing is to see what really works and what is just hype 
neutral, because you can see the results with the general public 
neutral, is this the right counter for gloves 
neutral,may i help you 
neutral, really what else have you discovered 
neutral, in the future that could be possible 
neutral, in that case shall i ask the waiter to bring you a knife and fork 
neutral, well i do not think i can manage with it 
neutral, peter pack them do not read them 
neutral, according to the article you have no real need to worry research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts not on recreating a whole human 
neutral, i m not sure i like the idea of that i don t want people copying me or other people it could be very confusing 
neutral, you have done a lot of traveling i will bet you have learned quite a bit 
neutral, there are several interesting articles on recent scientific breakthroughs i just finished reading one about cloning 
neutral,what are you reading about in that science magazine 
neutral, ok that sounds like a deal 
neutral, perfect it will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people 
neutral, of course not for me mountaineering is both relaxation and a hobby 
neutral, will it be an all day event

neutral,can you show me how to use chopsticks 
neutral, i will do my best 
neutral, ca not we go faster 
neutral, we are really in a hurry

neutral, oh it is not easy to learn 
neutral, you are so lucky if he bought you something for no special day i wonder what he would buy you for your birthday

neutral, why they hold a flour war 
neutral, they got rice flour and oil as presents while the leadership got 1000 yuan shopping card

neutral, dude don t equivocate a theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing you slept through class didn t you

neutral, now or later 
neutral, math sheath what s the evidence 
neutral, turtles whatever look all that s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti particles at least that s what the math says 
neutral, it s all religion take the theory of the big bang how is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion that s no better than atlas carrying the globe on his back or african myths about turtles and stuff 
neutral, dark please

neutral, you are right sir to prepare it a sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn reddish brown and then puts diced chicken breast meat into the pot with other condiments and peanuts that is why the dish has a bright colour

neutral, if i think of famous people i think of abraham lincoln 
neutral, he is great he always tells us not to study for exams and to pay more attention to communication rather than just memorizing 
neutral, sure you look like you are all black and blue 
neutral,waiter please make out the bill 
neutral, all right i will explain it to you later on now scram 
neutral, that s interesting they must be thinking of moving into that market are there any interesting editorials 
neutral, all right i will be back right away 
neutral, it s an article about language it talks about the idea of having a single global language 
neutral, it seems that english already is the main global language does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like esperanto as the world language 
neutral, actually it suggest english the main argument is that english is already being studied as a second language in most countries china india mexico nigeria pakistan and japan so beginning again 
neutral, do you like to use chopsticks 
neutral,do you buy that newspaper every day 
neutral, you re right it s sometimes hard to tell which pages are advertisement and which ones are articles 
neutral, all right i will take it 
neutral, they are neat now let is take that path into the woods and see what we can see 
neutral, yes i like using chopsticks 
neutral, does the article say anything about other language how will they survive in an english speaking world 
neutral, but it s so old 
neutral,it is really late but i am starving 
neutral, ok 
neutral, to be honest i like most of them except for my chinese teacher she is quite young but her class is too boring 
neutral, that is too bad do you have any foreign teachers 
neutral, no not at all 
neutral, hey that coffee shop is lights are still on 
neutral, maybe they have some good pie 
neutral, first of all it s a romance novel set in the early 19th century 
neutral, why not it s a classic in fact it s one of my favorite novels 
neutral,what are you reading 
neutral, yes i do i find it very informative it always has plenty of articles from correspondents all over the world and the business section is very useful too 
neutral, do you like some soup 
neutral, let me see there s the news section the entertainment section sports business and world affairs 
neutral, that is right you do not drink coffee do you 
neutral, no so it is usually boring to join my friends in the afternoon at a regular coffee shop 
neutral, what kind of things would you like to see on the menu 
neutral, i hope that they have a good menu most coffee shops only have coffee and danish 
neutral, what section does it have 
neutral, what s in that section 
neutral, yes there is it has several sections so it s quite a read it usually takes me a few hours to read it on sunday morning 
neutral, world affairs they look at the most important stories in more detail i find it fascinating do you buy a daily paper 
neutral,there is a new coffee shop opening up down the street 
neutral, yeah i would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones 
neutral, is there a sunday edition of that newspaper 
neutral, maybe a fruit salad and a few different hot sandwiches at least 
neutral, that should not be too difficult since this is a small neighborhood maybe they will take this suggestion 
neutral, save it until you have served dishes 
neutral, i buy a national newspaper sometimes buy i nearly always buy a local evening newspaper i find the local news more interesting than national or international news 
neutral, according to usual practices we serve dishes first and then soup if you like we will bring you some soup first 
neutral, what a pity 
neutral, we have beef soup and tomato soup 
neutral, let is do both are we in a rush or anything 
neutral, yes but i do not know what soup you have

neutral, yes my oral english teacher is an american he is from a small town in california 
neutral, thank you so much 
neutral, hangzhou food 
neutral,i see you have bought the latest copy of beauty and fashion are there any interesting articles in it 
neutral, since he doesn t have a son he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man that way all of his daughters will be cared for 
neutral, sure there you are 
neutral, yes sir where are you going 
neutral, it is a tag heer 
neutral, get on please 
neutral, mmmm that sounds like something i had in mexico once 
neutral, we have sichuan food hangzhou food and beijing food which do you like best 
neutral, of course not but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do according to the jealousy test i m quite a jealous type of person perhaps i need to control my jealousy 
neutral, what do you think about the teachers 
neutral, oh i see i like to do those tests too but i don t take them seriously 
neutral, you know tests like how jealous are you and are you a fashion victim 
neutral, there was a coffee shop by my house when i was a kid that served cinnamon hot chocolate 
neutral, i would love a really sticky cinnamon bun 
neutral, i didn t realize it was a romance novel what s the main storyline 
neutral, it s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls 
neutral, i m not surprised that article certainly added fuel to the debate ok thanks can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me i d like to read them 
neutral, that is really exciting how many months are you pregnant 
neutral, yeah you are right but it is really interesting
